1) Discussion reframing


Beef up within person stuff. These are a different set of questions that you can ask. People are already doing it. Here are some examples and inferences. There could be another paper on the set of within-person inferences.

Any time you are thinking about longitudinal data — within or between-unit inferences — there are additional complexities that you need to consider. There are things that your models will not reveal to you if you are not looking for them. 

Stationarity and ergodicity are important for all longitudinal inferences.

2) Introduction

Mention in the introduction that we are focusing on between-unit inferences. There is a difference in between-unit vs. within-unit, and we come back to that distinction in the discussion.

Perhaps throw in stationarity and ergodicity in the introduction. We focus on models that assume homogeneous dynamics. 

Mention that some of the inferences vary in their exposure. We aren’t only focusing on research questions that people use. We used common research questions as a foundation, but also incorporated research questions that are not all that common.
