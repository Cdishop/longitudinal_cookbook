# Last meeting with Goran

We discussed between-person inferences. An alternative framework for inferences with longitudinal data is within person inferences. Longitudinal data gives you the opportunity to explore both, but often you cannot flip between the two due to stationarity and ergodicity. Those concepts are tough, we don't discuss them here. Recognize that resource constraints

advocate for small sample large t




1) Discussion reframing


Beef up within person stuff. These are a different set of questions that you can ask. People are already doing it. Here are some examples and inferences. There could be another paper on the set of within-person inferences.

Any time you are thinking about longitudinal data — within or between-unit inferences — there are additional complexities that you need to consider. There are things that your models will not reveal to you if you are not looking for them. 

Stationarity and ergodicity are important for all longitudinal inferences.

2) Introduction

Mention in the introduction that we are focusing on between-unit inferences. There is a difference in between-unit vs. within-unit, and we come back to that distinction in the discussion.

Perhaps throw in stationarity and ergodicity in the introduction. We focus on models that assume homogeneous dynamics. 

Mention that some of the inferences vary in their exposure. We aren’t only focusing on research questions that people use. We used common research questions as a foundation, but also incorporated research questions that are not all that common.
