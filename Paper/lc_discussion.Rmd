# Discussion

There are many different patterns to explore with longitudinal data structures. This manuscript, by unpacking between-unit patterns, mirrors the common questions and inferences currently emphasized by organizational scientists. What is the relationship among a set of constructs (averaged over time)? What is the expected trend? Are there differences in trend (also phrased as, "between-unit differences in within-unit change")? We organized these questions and inferences into a fundamental set, discussed what they mean, and consolidated disparate literature so that researchers have a single source to better understand how to think about over time patterns. Our discussion and figures were designed to reduce ambiguity about patterns in longitudinal data and help researchers ask questions effectively. Ultimately, researchers should now be able to understand the spectrum of inferences that they can explore with rich, longitudinal data.  

Between-unit questions are common and useful and they are the sibling to an alternative lens to asking questions and making inferences with repeated measures: within-units. Within-unit inferences emphasize fluctuations over time rather than across units. For example, Beal [-@beal_esm_2015] notes that many of the psychological phenomenon in which we are interested are "sequences of events and event reactions that happen within each person's stream of experience" (p. 5). This is a within-unit statement: it emphasizes how a construct moves through time within a single individual. Organizational scientists have become increasingly interested in within-unit perspectives over the past decade. @dalal2014within review theory and research on within-person job performance, @grandey2015emotional review emotional labor and differentiate a variety of within-person perspectives, @park2013advancing present a team motivation model describing within-individual resource allocation and within-team feedback, @vancouver2010formal present a within-person model of multiple-goal pursuit, @barnes2012working describes recent within-person approaches to sleep and organizational behavior, and @methot2017good present a within-person perspective of organizational citizenship behaviors. There are many within-person inferences accumulating in our literature, but they are occasionally accompanied by between-person models or are dispersed and unconnected among different content areas. An immediate next step for future research is to create a framework for the fundamental within-unit inferences. 

Our focus was on between-unit patterns because these inferences are the backbone of longitudinal modeling and inference in organizational science. Moreover, there can be a tendency for researchers to believe that they are making within-unit inferences simply because they collect longitudinal data, our goal was to build consensus and clarity on the fundamental between-unit ideas in longitudinal data structures. 

We close with four key takeaways. First, knowing the different patterns that you can explore with longitudinal data is crucial to operating as an organizational scholar. These data sets are becomming more and more common [@spector_not_2019] so graduate students, practitioners, and academics are bound to come across such data in their career. Without knowing the fundamental patterns that are possible to explore, researchers will have a hard time asking good questions to guide their research designs, have a limited understanding of how to evaluate other longitudinal research, and miss potential insights. 

Second, questions come before statistical models. We presented ways of asking questions and thinking about longitudinal data, and only after discussing those concepts were possible citations for statistical models provided. The insight here is that questions should drive research design, data collection, and statistical modeling. A researcher first asks, "what questions do I have?" "What inferences do I want to make?" And only after thinking hard about those concepts moves on to questions about reserach design, data collection, and possible statistical models that can be applied to the data that align with the initial question. A researcher should never couch him or herself within a single inference category simply because he or she is only familiar with one statistical model. What is your question? What inference do you want to make? Then choose a statistical model that is consistent with those interests. 

Third, and building off point two, certain questions and inferences require specific statistical models. Xu, DeShon, and Dishop (in press) demonstrated that multi-level (or hierarchical linear) models are innapropriate for inferences about dynamics. Knowing how inferences about dynamics differ from inferences about trends or relationships, therefore, is critical for choosing an appropriate statistical model. 

Fourth, all of the ideas presented here can be used in harmony to learn about the temporal nature of a phenomenon. A researcher does not have to limit him or herself to a single inference category. Each is a unique way of asking questions about patterns contained in longitudinal data structures and, after potentially asking many questions about the same assessed constructs, a researcher can learn about multiple aspects of the phenomenon.
