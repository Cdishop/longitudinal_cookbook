# Discussion

There are many different patterns to explore with multiple-unit, longitudinal data structures. What is the average trend in performance? Is it consistent across people or organizations? What is its initial or ending level? Does the performance trend covary with a predictor or trend in another variable? Does performance show self-similarity or memory? Or a lagged relationship with other variables? Is it part of a reciprocal system? We organized these questions and inferences into a fundamental set, discussed what they mean, and linked the inferences to appropriate statistical models. Ultimately, researchers should now be able to understand the spectrum of inferences that they can explore with rich, multiple-unit longitudinal data.
