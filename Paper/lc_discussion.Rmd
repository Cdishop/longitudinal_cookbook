# Discussion

There are many different patterns to explore with longitudinal data structures. This paper, by unpacking between-unit patterns, mirrors the common questions and inferences currently emphasized by organizational scientists. What is the between-unit relationship (averaged over time)? What is the between-unit expected trend? Are there between-unit differences in trend (also phrased as, "between-unit differences in within-unit change")? We organized these questions and inferences into a fundamental set, discussed what they mean, and linked the inferences to appropriate statistical models. Ultimately, researchers should now be able to understand the spectrum of between-unit inferences that they can explore with rich, longitudinal data.  

Between-unit questions are common and useful, but an alternative lens to asking questions and making inferences with repeated measures is to focus on within-unit patterns. Within-unit inferences emphasize fluctuations over time rather than across units. For example, Beal [-@beal_esm_2015] notes that many of the psychological phenomenon in which we are interested are "sequences of events and event reactions that happen within each person's stream of experience" (p. 5). This is a within-unit statement: it emphasizes how a construct moves through time within a single individual. 

Organizational scientists have become increasingly interested in within-unit perspectives over the past decade. @dalal2014within review theory and research on within-person job performance, @grandey2015emotional review emotional labor and differentiate a variety of within-person perspectives, @park2013advancing present a team motivation model describing within-individual resource allocation and within-team feedback, @vancouver2010formal present a within-person model of multiple-goal pursuit, @barnes2012working describes recent within-person approaches to sleep and organizational behavior, and @methot2017good present a within-person perspective of organizational citizenship behaviors. 

Taking a within-persons perspective requires greater $T$ -- researchers must collect observations over more time points. To collect more observations (over time), researchers can extend their sampling periods (e.g., collect once-a-week observations for 50 weeks rather than 10) or increase the frequency of their observations (e.g., sample three, rather than two, times per day). Adding additional observations of course increases the power of the analysis, but it also allows researchers to assess important statistical properties that must receive attention -- although they are currently absent in our literature -- during within-unit modeling: stationarity and ergodicity.

Processes give rise to observed data, and those observed data are characterized by distributions and their moments. Stationarity is about whether or not the statistical characteristics of a process remain stable over time. When they do, the analyst has permission to use a variety of regression-based techniques like those described in this paper without additional concerns of faulty inferences. When trajectories are non-stationary, however, then the inferences drawn from regression-based techniques are often misguided [@granger_spurious_1974]. Growth-models assume non-stationarity, whereas the other statistical models discussed in this paper assume stationarity. Full explanations of stationarity are in @kuljanin_cautionary_2011, @braun_spurious_2013, @jebb2015time, and @metcalfe2009introductory, we draw attention to it here to emphasize that studies with greater $T$ have the ability to assess stationarity and understand which statistical models are appropriate. Moreover, finding evidence of (non)stationary is useful theoretical knowledge and needs to take the foreground of studies that collect longitudinal data.

Ergodicity is another statistical characteristic of a process, and it is important because it determines whether or not researchers can generalize inferences about inter-individual variability from tests of between-unit differences to inferences of within-unit variability. To see the dilemma, consider the following. First, the standard statistical models in psychology and management, such as growth curves, multi-level models, mixture modeling, ANOVA, and factor analysis all focus on between-unit variation [@molenaar_manifesto_2004]. Second, researchers using these techniques run their computations on a sample drawn from a population and then generalize their results back to the population, so (a) the results live at the level of the population and (b) researchers assume that the population (or sub population in mixture modeling) is homogenous [@molenaar2009new]. These notions are fine on their own,  but researchers tend to make an additional assumption that is unlikely to hold: because resuls live at the level of the population and because researchers assume that the population is homogenous they often also assume that the results apply to the individuals making up the population [@molenaar2008implications]. In other words, they assume that the results from a test of between-unit variation hold at the level of within-individual variation.

When processes are ergodic, this implicit assumption holds: the results of an analysis of between-unit differences generalize to within-unit patterns and vice versa [@molenaar2007psychological; @molenaar2008consequences]. Researchers can generalize with ergodic processes, they can use a multi-level model to assess between-unit patterns and then make statements about within-person relationships. But this generalization is rarely appropriate. A Gaussian process is non-ergodic if it is non-stationarity (e.g., it has time-varying trends) and/or heterogeneous across subjects (subject-specific dynamics). Stated simply, a Gaussian process is non-ergodic if it has trend and/or Susie's trajectory is different from Bob's. If either is violated, which is often the case, then standard analyses of between-subject differences (growth models, multi-level or random-coefficient models, mixture models, ANOVA, factor analysis) cannot be used to make within-person statements. In general, within-person inferences need to come from unpooled, subject-specific time-series data structures [@molenaar2009generalization]. 

Collecting large samples across many time points allows researchers to assess stationarity and ergodicity. We urge researchers to start focusing on both so that our field can begin to understand the similarities and differences among between-unit and within-unit relationships. Again, researchers must collect data across many time points to do so. 

Often, though, researchers have finite resources and must decide whether to emphasize between-unit or within-unit patterns. Your data collection should align with the inference that you are interested in. If you care about between-unit patterns (as shown in this paper), focus on N -- collect data on many participants. If you care about within-unit patterns, focus on T -- collect data across many time points. Large samples across many time points of course gives researchers the ability to explore both frameworks, but our field will need to recognize that a small samples (e.g., five or fewer participants) measured across many time points does allow a researcher to make within-person inferences. Given the resource constraints that come with conducting research, we cannot shy away from few participants measured across many time points as viable techniques to assessing within-person relationships.
