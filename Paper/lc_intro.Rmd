Organizational scientists recognize that psychological phenomena and processes unfold over time [@beal_esm_2015; @pitariu_explaining_2010]. Individuals in the workplace, over time, strive to accomplish work goals, team members collaborate so the whole eventually becomes greater than the sum of its parts, and managers repeatedly promote values to build vibrant, innovative work cultures. To better understand psychological phenomena, such as motivation, teamwork, and organizational culture, researchers must attend not to static snapshots of behavior  [@ilgen_computational_2000; @kozlowski_advancing_2013; @kozlowski_capturing_2016] but to actors, events, variables and relationships as they move through time. Obtaining longitudinal data allows researchers to capture the unfolding set of events, interactions, behaviors, cognitions, or affective reactions across a variety of psychological phenomena. If practitioners and scholars, however, are unfamiliar with the many questions that they can ask of longitudinal data -- and how those questions do or do not pair with certain statistical models -- then the inferences that they draw from it are at best restricted and, at worst, spurious.  

Researchers have the opportunity to explore many inferences when they analyze longitudinal data. For example, researchers may examine the shape of trajectories on psychological constructs (e.g., Did job satisfaction generally increase or decrease during the past six months?), how two or more constructs relate to each other (e.g., Did team communication and cohesion positively correlate over time?), or whether changes in one variable relate to changes in another [e.g., Did changes in goal-setting relate to changes in employee performance? @dunford_is_2012; @hardy_interrelationships_2018; @jones_baby_2016; @judge_what_2014; @lanaj_when_2016; @rosen_who_2016; @scott_multilevel_2011]. Given the variety of available inferences with longitudinal data, an organizing framework would elucidate their subtle differences and enhance theoretical insight.

We developed a framework that organizes some of the fundamental patterns that researchers may explore with longitudinal data. In this paper, we use it to describe how to think about patterns contained in longitudinal or panel data structures. Our manuscript is timely for two reasons. First, it consolidates disparate literature. The ways of thinking (i.e., inference categories) that we describe are not new, they are contained in the organizational literature already, but they are often discussed in isolation which limits a common understanding of how they fit together. To demonstrate this point, we conducted a brief review of articles published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* and the *Journal of Business and Psychology* in the years 2017 and 2018 that contained three or more waves of data with every variable measured at each time point. Twenty-eight studies were identified and, using the study hypotheses, introductions, and discussions, classified according to the inference categories that we discuss in this paper. Table 1 reports the frequencies of each inference across the 28 studies. The specific inference categories (trend, relationships, and dynamics) will be fully developed later, what matters here is that a majority of the reviewed studies explored a single inference category, and no study focused on all three. We are not saying that researchers and practitioners must ask all questions possible of their longitudinal data, but we are pointing out that other inferences and ways of thinking about patterns exist that researchers may not be aware of. This paper presents each inference in a single location rather than forcing researchers to locate and parse disparate literature to understand what they can ask of longitudinal data. Second, a recent article noted that, despite a growing emphasis on dynamics in organizational science, certain statistical models are inappropriate for inferences about dynamics [@xu2019challenges]. The authors state that researchers should consider whether their interest is dynamics or other over time patterns and choose their statistical model accordingly. Researchers, therefore, need to know how dynamic inferences differ from other, related inferences. Here, we fully describe those differences. 

# Longitudinal Research in Applied Psychology

This paper is devoted to inferences with repeated measures, so we begin with a few labels and definitions. Authors typically identify a "longitudinal" study by contrasting either (a) research designs or (b) data structures. Longitudinal *research* is different from cross-sectional research because longitudinal designs entail three or more repeated observations [@ployhart_longitudinal_2010]. We therefore emphasize differences on the number of observations when we distinguish longitudinal from other types of research. Longitudinal or panel *data* are repeated observations on several units (i.e., $N$ or $i$ > 1), whereas time-series data are observations of one unit over time -- a distinction that focuses on the amount of people in the study (given repeated measures). Most organizational studies collect data on more than one unit, therefore our discussion below focuses on longitudinal research with panel data, or designs with $N$ > 1, $t$ $\geq$ 3, and the same construct(s) measured on each $i$ at each $t$. That is, we focus on designs with repeated measures across many people (units) where every variable is measured at each time point. 

Longitudinal applies to both short and long-term research. An experiment with ten trials is longitudinal, as is a study spanning 10 years that assesses its measures once every year. Longitudinal is not reserved for "long-term" studies that last more than one year irrespective of the frequency of their observations. Rather, certain processes unfold over short time horizons [e.g., decision-making on simple tasks, swift action teams; @wildman2012trust] whereas other psychological phenomena unfold over long time horizons [e.g., the development of a shared organizational culture; @mitchell_building_2001], so the informativeness of a particular study depends on its rationale, research design, analytical work, and effective interpretation of results -- as with any study. Short and long time horizons both offer valuable insights.

# Framework for Longitudinal Inferences

We use three inference categories to partition our discussion, including trends, relationships, and dynamics. Briefly, longitudinal inferences focusing on trends assess whether trajectories follow a predictable growth pattern, longitudinal inferences focusing on relationships assess the relationship between one or more constructs, and longitudinal inferences focusing on dynamics assess how one or more constructs move through time as functions of themselves and each other and emphasize how the past constrains the future. Each category comes with box-and-arrow model heuristics[^1] that represent the broad inferences, research questions to orient the reader as to what the sub-inferences capture (i.e., inferences are the answers to the research questions that we present), and references for statistical models that are appropriate for a given inference. 

Consistent with the typical inferences in organizational science, the inferences described here are between-unit, meaning that they reflect the average relationship across the unit of focus for a particular study (e.g., the relationship across people, or the relationship across firms). The typical statistical model applied to panel data in organizational science reflects the average relationship of interest across units in a given sample, providing a population-level estimate of a given relationship. Alternatively, time-series designs focus on single units and all inferences are interpreted at the within-unit level, generating a unit-level estimate of a given relationship. Time-series designs, however, are not popular in our literature so they are not described further. 

Although we use box-and-arrow diagrams throughout to represent the broad inferences, we also graph a few of the more challenging inferences with mock data -- some of the inferences in the trend and relationships sections are difficult to grasp without seeing them in data form. Keep in mind, however, that data are always messy. It is rare to find data in which the inferences present themselves simply by plotting -- althought it is certainly possible. We use these "data plots" to clearly convey what the inferences mean, but be aware that field data are often noisy. 

Finally, despite pointing researchers to statistical models, our paper puts a majority of its emphasis on inferences, therefore researchers need to be sure that they appreciate all of the nuance before applying a recommended statistical model. Numerous issues arise when modeling longitudinal data and the statistical models differ in how they handle these issues, the assumptions they make, and the data format they require. We do not speak directly to those issues here, but we refer readers to a number of informative references for each statistical model. 

[^1]: Note that statistical models differ from the term, "model heuristic." A model heuristic is a visual representation only, whereas a statistical model is characterized by a formula explaining the data and assumptions on the errors, and the parameters of statistical models are estimated using an estimation technique. In this paper, we never use the term, "model" without pairing it either with "statistical" or "heuristic" -- the two differ substantially.
