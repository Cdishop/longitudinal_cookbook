Organizational scientists recognize that psychological phenomena and processes unfold over time [@beal_esm_2015; @pitariu_explaining_2010]. Individuals in the workplace, over time, strive to accomplish work goals, team members collaborate so the whole eventually becomes greater than the sum of its parts, and managers repeatedly promote values to build vibrant, innovative work cultures. To better understand psychological phenomena, such as motivation, teamwork, and organizaitonal culture, researchers must attent not to static snapshots of behavior  [@ilgen_computational_2000; @kozlowski_advancing_2013; @kozlowski_capturing_2016] but to variables and relationships as they move through time. Obtaining longitudinal data allows researchers to capture the unfolding set of events, interactions, behaviors, cognitions, or affective reactions across a variety of psychological phenomena.

Researchers have the opportunity to explore many inferences when they analyze longitudinal data. For example, researchers may examine the shape of trajectories on psychological constructs (e.g., Did job satisfaction generally increase or decrease during the past six months?), how two or more constructs relate to each other (e.g., Did team communication and cohesion positively correlate over time?), or whether changes in one variable relate to changes in another [e.g., Did changes in goal-setting relate to changes in employee performance? @dunford_is_2012; @hardy_interrelationships_2018; @jones_baby_2016; @judge_what_2014; @lanaj_when_2016; @rosen_who_2016; @scott_multilevel_2011]. Given the variety of available inferences with longitudinal data, an organizing framework would elucidate their subtle differences, enhance theoretical insight, guide data collection, and facilitate sound analytical work. 

We developed a framework to capture these inferences, a way to organize the fundamental between-unit patterns researchers explore with longitudinal data despite focusing on different content areas or using different statistical models. Researchers often focus on one famililiar inference despite having the data to explore many more fundamental patterns. We bring attention to the span of questions available so that researchers can fully appreciate and take advantage of their data. Moreover, there are many complex statistical models lingering in our literature and it is not always clear for which questions they are appropriate. We provide readers with potential models for each inference so that they can be sure that the model they evoke is appropriate for the research question that they are interested in. In summary, this paper exposes researchers to the span of between-unit inferences they may investigate when they collect longitudinal data, links those inferences to statistical models, and explains differences between various longitudinal inferences.

# Longitudinal Research in Applied Psychology

This paper is devoted to inferences with repeated measures, so we begin with a few labels and definitions. Authors typically identify a "longitudinal" study by contrasting either (a) research designs or (b) data structures. Longitudinal *research* is different from cross-sectional research because longitudinal designs entail three or more repeated observations [@ployhart_longitudinal_2010]. We therefore emphasize differences on the number of observations when we distinguish longitudinal from other types of research. Longitudinal or panel *data* are repeated observations on several units (i.e., $N$ or $i$ > 1), whereas time-series data are observations of one unit over time -- a distinction that focuses on the amount of people in the study (given repeated measures). Most organizational studies collect data on more than one unit, therefore our discussion below focuses on longitudinal research with panel data, or designs with $N$ > 1, $t$ $\geq$ 3, and the same construct(s) measured on each $i$ at each $t$. That is, we focus on designs with repeated measures across many people (units) where every variable is measured at each time point. 

Longitudinal applies to both short and long-term research. An experiment with ten trials is longitudinal, as is a study spanning 10 years that assesses its measures once every year. Longitudinal is not reserved for "long-term" studies that last more than one year irrespective of the frequency of their observations. Rather, certain processes unfold over short time horizons [e.g., decision-making on simple tasks, swift action teams; @wildman2012trust] whereas other psychological phenomena unfold over long time horizons [e.g., the development of a shared organizational culture; @mitchell_building_2001], so the informativeness of a particular study depends on its rationale, research design, analytical work, and effective interpretation of results -- as with any study. Short and long time horizons both offer valuable insights.

# Framework for Longitudinal Inferences

We use three inference categories to partition our discussion, including trends, relationships, and dynamics. Briefly, longitudinal inferences focusing on trends assess whether trajectories follow a predictable pattern or whether trajectories differ between-units; longitudinal inferences focusing on relationships between constructs assess the between-unit relationship among one or more constructs; longitudinal inferences focusing on dynamics in constructs assess how one or more constructs move through time as functions of themselves and each other and emphasize how the past constrains the future. Each category comes with box-and-arrow model heuristics[^1] that represent the broad inferences, research questions to orient the reader as to what the sub-inferences capture (i.e., inferences are the answers to the research questions that we present), and a discussion of statistical models. 

Although we use box-and-arrow diagrams throughout to represent the broad inferences, we also graph a few of the more challenging inferences with mock data -- some of the inferences in the trend and relationships sections are difficult to grasp without seeing them in data form. Keep in mind, however, that data are always messy. It is rare to find data in which the inferences present themselves simply by plotting -- althought it is certainly possible. We use these "data plots" to clearly convey what the inferences mean, but be aware that field data are often noisy. 

Finally, despite pointing researchers to statistical models, our paper puts a majority of its emphasis on inferences, therefore researchers need to be sure that they appreciate all of the nuance before applying a recommended statistical model. Numerous issues arise when modeling longitudinal data and the statistical models differ in how they handle these issues, the assumptions they make, and the data format they require. We do not speak directly to those issues here, but we refer readers to a number of informative references for each statistical model. 

[^1]: Note that statistical models differ from the term, "model heuristic." A model heuristic is a visual representation only, whereas a statistical model is characterized by a formula explaining the data and assumptions on the errors, and the parameters of statistical models are estimated using an estimation technique. In this paper, we never use the term, "model" without pairing it either with "statistical" or "heuristic" -- the two differ substantially.
