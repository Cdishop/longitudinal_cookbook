Organizational scientists readily recognize psychological phenomena and processes unfold over time [@beal_esm_2015; @braun2013spurious; @kuljanin2011cautionary; @pitariu_explaining_2010]. Individuals in the workplace strive to accomplish work goals energized by motivational processes (e.g., goal-setting); team members collaborate so the whole becomes greater, instead of less, than the sum of its parts; managers promote values to build vibrant, innovative work cultures. In order to better understand psychological processes and phenomena such as motivation, teamwork, and organizaitonal culture, researchers must go beyond observing and analyzing static snapshots of individual and collective affect, behavior, and cognition  [@ilgen_computational_2000]. They must observe or obtain longitudinal data capturing the unfolding set of events, interactions, behaviors, cognitions, affective reactions responsible for psychological processes and phenomena [@mitchell_building_2001]. Fortunately, available technology (e.g., hand-held devices, online platforms, sensors, computer tracking, text traces, cameras) and data repositories (e.g., organizational databases, open science framework) makes it easier to collect or obtain longitudinal data than previously possible. Obtaining and analyzing longitudinal data illuminates organizational psychological functioning at any or multiple levels of analysis. 

Researchers may explore a variety of inferences when they analyze longitudinal data. In particular, researchers may examine whether individual or average trajectories increase or decrease on psychological constructs of interest (e.g., did job satisfaction generally increase or decrease over six months after a merger?), how two or more psychological constructs relate to each other (e.g., did team communications and cohesion positively correlate during the last project?), or whether changes in one or more set of psychological constructs leads to changes in another set of psychological constructs [e.g., did changes in goal-setting lead to changes in employee performance?; @dunford_is_2012; @hardy_interrelationships_2018; @jones_baby_2016; @judge_what_2014; @lanaj_when_2016; @rosen_who_2016; @scott_multilevel_2011]. Given the variety of inferences researchers may explore with longitudinal data, an organizing framework for longitudinal inferences not only facilitates longitudinal analytical work and elucidates nuanced differences between such inferences, but, also, enhances theoretical thought and guides data collection efforts.    

We develop a framework to capture fundemental patterns researchers may explore with longitudinal data. Researchers often focus on one familiar inference despite possessing the data to explore many more fundamental patterns. Understanding the set of patterns one may explore with longitudinal data expands the possible insights into investigated phenomena and processes. We bring attention to the span of questions available so that researchers can fully appreciate and take advantage of their data. Furthermore, we describe statistical models useful for examining discussed longitudinal inferences.  This takes researchers from conceptually discussing their longitudinal inferences to evaluating them analytically while, at the same time, appropriately specifying longitudinal statistical models.  In summary, this work organizes for researchers the span of inferences they may investigate when they collect longitudinal data, links longitudinal inferences to statistical models, and explains differences between various longitudinal inferences.

# Longitudinal Definitions

This paper is exclusively devoted to inferences with respect to repeated measures, so we begin by identifying a few labels and definitions. Authors typically identify a "longitudinal" study by contrasting either (a) research designs or (b) data structures. Longitudinal *research* is different from cross-sectional research because longitudinal designs entail three or more repeated observations [@ployhart_longitudinal_2010]. We therefore emphasize differences on the number of observations when we distinguish longitudinal from other types of research. Longitudinal *data* are repeated observations on several units (i.e., $N$ or $i$ > 1), whereas panel data are observations of one unit over time -- a distinction that focuses on the amount of people in our study (given repeated measures). Most organizational studies collect data on more than one unit, therefore our discussion below focuses on longitudinal research with longitudinal data, or designs with $N$ > 1, $t$ >= 3, and the same construct(s) measured on each $i$ at each $t$. That is, we focus on designs with repeated measures across many people (units) where every variable is measured at each time point. 

Note that longitudinal applies to both short and long-term research. An experiment with ten trials is longitudinal, as is a study spanning 10 years that assesses its measures once every year. Longitudinal is not reserved for "long-term" studies that last more than one year irrespective of the frequency of their observations. Assessing variables and relationships within a 60 minute study can be as informative as a study that spans multiple years given adequate sampling frequency -- the two simply emphasize different features.

# Framework

We use three inference categories to partition our discussion, including trend, relationships, and dynamics, and each has its own sub-inferences and models. Our writing style is the same throughout each section, where we first discuss the category itself and then sequentially walk through the inferences. During that sequence, we pose questions to orient the reader as to what the inference captures, unpack graphs and figures, and provide inference statements that can be used to guide hypothesis development. We use box-and-arrow diagrams throughout to represent the broad inferences, but we also graph a few of the more challenging inferences with mock data -- some of the inferences in the trend and relationships sections are difficult to grasp without seeing them in data form. Keep in mind, however, that data are always messy. It is rare to find data where the inferences expose themselves simply by plotting -- although it is certainly possible. We are using these "data plots" to clearly convey what the inferences mean, but please be aware that field data will always be convoluted.

Finally, we end each inference section by pointing researchers to respective statistical models. Although we direct researchers to models, our paper is not about statistical modeling only -- it is about inferences -- and researchers therefore need to be sure that they appreciate all of the nuance before applying a recommended model. There are many complex statistical issues that arise with longitudinal modeling -- like stationarity -- and the models differ in how they handle these issues, the assumptions they make, and the data format they require. There are plenty of great references on each model, we are simply guiding researchers to those references based on the underlying inferences that interest them.
