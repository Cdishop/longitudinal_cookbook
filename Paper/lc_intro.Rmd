Organizational scientists readily recognize psychological phenomena and processes unfold over time [@beal_esm_2015; @braun2013spurious; @kuljanin2011cautionary; @pitariu_explaining_2010]. Individuals in the workplace strive to accomplish work goals energized by motivational processes (e.g., goal-setting); team members collaborate so the whole becomes greater, instead of less, than the sum of its parts; managers promote values to build vibrant, innovative work cultures. In order to better understand psychological processes and phenomena such as motivation, teamwork, and organizaitonal culture, researchers must go beyond observing and analyzing static snapshots of individual and collective affect, behavior, and cognition  [@ilgen_computational_2000; @kozlowski_advancing_2013; @kozlowski_capturing_2016]. They must observe or obtain longitudinal data capturing the unfolding set of events, interactions, behaviors, cognitions, or affective reactions responsible for psychological processes and phenomena. Fortunately, available technology (e.g., hand-held devices, online platforms, sensors, computer tracking, text traces, cameras) and data repositories (e.g., organizational databases, open science framework) makes it easier to collect or obtain longitudinal data than previously possible. Obtaining and analyzing longitudinal data illuminates organizational psychological functioning at any or multiple levels of analysis. 

Researchers may explore a variety of inferences when they analyze longitudinal data. In particular, researchers may examine whether individual or average trajectories increase or decrease on psychological constructs of interest (e.g., did job satisfaction generally increase or decrease over six months after a merger?), how two or more psychological constructs relate to each other (e.g., did team communications and cohesion positively correlate during the last project?), or whether changes in one or more set of psychological constructs leads to changes in another set of psychological constructs [e.g., did changes in goal-setting lead to changes in employee performance?; @dunford_is_2012; @hardy_interrelationships_2018; @jones_baby_2016; @judge_what_2014; @lanaj_when_2016; @rosen_who_2016; @scott_multilevel_2011]. Given the variety of inferences researchers may explore with longitudinal data, an organizing framework for longitudinal inferences not only facilitates longitudinal analytical work and elucidates nuanced differences between such inferences, but, also, enhances theoretical thought and guides data collection efforts.    

We develop a framework to capture fundemental patterns researchers may explore with longitudinal data. Researchers often focus on one familiar inference despite possessing the data to explore many more fundamental patterns. Understanding the set of patterns one may explore with longitudinal data expands the possible insights into investigated phenomena and processes. We bring attention to the span of questions available so that researchers can fully appreciate and take advantage of their data. Furthermore, we describe statistical models useful for examining longitudinal inferences.  This takes researchers from conceptually discussing their longitudinal inferences to evaluating them analytically while, at the same time, appropriately specifying longitudinal statistical models.  In summary, this work organizes for researchers the span of inferences they may investigate when they collect longitudinal data, links longitudinal inferences to statistical models, and explains differences between various longitudinal inferences.

# Longitudinal Research in Psychology

This work exclusively devotes its attention to inferences with respect to repeated measures on units of observation in psychological research. First, longitudinal data differs from cross-sectional data because longitudinal designs entail three or more repeated measurements on the same units of analysis on one or more constructs [@ployhart_longitudinal_2010]. Two repeated measurements prohibits the evaluation of different trends as the linear trend perfectly fits all units of observation.  Second, in most cases in psychological research, longitudinal data consists of repeated observations on more than one unit of observation, whereas panel data consists of observations on one unit over time such as one finds in economics research. Thus, we focus our attention to inferences researchers can make from longitudinal data consisting of at least three repeated measurements on one or more constructs observed on more than one unit.  

We highlight longitudinal data in psychological research may cover short or long time horizons. In other words, we consider both an experiment tracking participant behavior on ten trials and a study tracking participant attitudes once every year for ten years as longitudinal research. Certain psychological phenomena and processes unfold over short time horizons (e.g., decision-making on simple tasks) whereas other psychological phenomena and processes unfold over long time horizons [e.g., team performance on complex tasks; @mitchell_building_2001]. Thus, longitudinal psychological research does not merely consist of long time horizon studies. Short time horizon studies can equally well inform researchers on suitable phenomena and processes operating at such time scales. Ultimately, the informativeness of a particular study depends on its rationale, research design, potent analytical work, and effective interpretation of results as with any study. When it comes to longitudinal research in psychology, short and long time horizons both offer valuable insights into psychological phenomena and processes.  

# Framework for Longitudinal Inferences

We use three broad inference categories to partition our discussion on construct: trends, relationships, and dynamics.  Briefly, longitudinal inferences focusing on trends in constructs assess whether change on constructs follows linear or curvilinear trajectories or whether trajectories differ between individuals; longitudinal inferences focusing on relationships between constructs assess the extent to which two or more constructs associate with one another over time; longitudinal inferences focusing on dynamics in constructs assess how one or more constructs evolve as functions of themselves and each other. Each category comes with a discussion of its own set of sub-inferences and statistical models. We proceed by posing questions to illuniate what each broad inference category and its associated sub-inferences capture, visualize inferential ideas with figures, and provide inferential statements useful to guide longitudinal hypothesis development. We use diagrams to represent the broad inferences and graph hypothetical data to explicate differences between sub-inferences. 

We intend for the hypothetical data plots to illuminate the meaning behind inferences and not to indicate actual longitudinal data looks this cleanly. Actual data tends to look noisier. To handle nosiy data, we turn to statistical models to facilitate inferences. Thus, we refer to respective statistical models useful to investigate discussed inferences. Although we direct researchers to statistical models, we primarily emphasize inferences with longitudinal data. We wish researchers better understand the available set of longitudinal inferences the may investigate before applying statistical models. Numerous complex statistical issues arise when modeling longitudinal data such as stationarity [see @braun2013spurious; @braun_spurious_2013; @kuljanin2011cautionary], and statistical models differ in how they handle these issues, the assumptions they make, and the data format they require. In this work, we cannot speak to these matters, and we refer readers to numerous informative references for each statistical model.
