Organizational phenomena unfold over time. They are processes that develop, change, and evolve [@pitariu_explaining_2010] that create a sequence of events within a person's stream of experience [@beal_esm_2015]. Moreover, organizations are systems with many connected parts, and systems are inherently dynamic. Studying these systems and processes, therefore, requires that we attend not to static snapshots of behavior [@ilgen_computational_2000], but to variables and relationships as they move through time; doing so puts us in a better position to capture the sequence, understand it, and can lead to new and interesting insights [@kozlowski_work_2003].

Researchers explore a variety of inferences when they apply models to longitudinal data. Some focus on whether trajectories increase or decrease, others highlight relationships, and many appear to be increasingly interested in dynamics [e.g., @dunford_is_2012; @hardy_interrelationships_2018; @jones_baby_2016; @judge_what_2014; @lanaj_when_2016; @rosen_who_2016; @scott_multilevel_2011]. How are these common ways of asking questions about patterns in longitudinal data different? 

We developed a framework to capture these inferences; a way to organize the fundemental patterns researchers explore with longitudinal data despite focusing on different content areas or using different statistical models. Researchers often focus on one familiar inference despite having the data to explore many more fundamental patterns. There are also a number of complex statistical models lingering in our literature and it is not always obvious for which questions they are appropriate. We bring attention to the span of questions available so that researchers can fully appreciate and take advantage of their data. Although the inferences all concern trajectories over time, their small differences have large implications for what we take away from them -- what we ultimately conclude. We provide readers with potential models for each inference so that they can be sure that the model they evoke is appropriate for the research question that they are interested in. In summary, this paper exposes researchers to the span of inferences they may investigate when they collect longitudinal data, links those inferences to models, and parses some of the modeling literature that may be difficult to consume for researchers with only graduate level training in statistics.

# Longitudinal Definitions

This paper is exclusively devoted to inferences with respect to data sets containing repeated observations, so we begin by identifying a few labels and definitions. Authors typically identify a "longitudinal" study by contrasting either (a) research designs or (b) data structures. Longitudinal *research* is different from cross-sectional research because longitudinal designs entail three or more repeated observations [@ployhart_longitudinal_2010]. We therefore emphasize differences on the number of observations when we distinguish longitudinal from other types of research. Longitudinal *data* are repeated observations on several units (i.e., $N$ or $i$ > 1), whereas panel data are observations of one unit over time -- a distinction that focuses on the amount of people in our study (given repeated measures). Most organizational studies collect data on more than one unit, therefore our discussion below focuses on longitudinal research with longitudinal data, or designs with $N$ > 1, $t$ >= 3, and the same construct(s) measured on each $i$ at each $t$. That is, we focus on designs that measure their variables repeatedly across many people -- and every variable is measured at each time point.

Note that longitudinal applies to both short and long-term research. An experiment with ten trials is longitudinal, as is a study spanning 10 years that assesses its measures once every year. Longitudinal is not reserved for "long-term" studies that last more than one year irrespective of the frequency of their observations. Assessing variables and relationships within a 60 minute study can be as informative as a study that spans multiple years given adequate sampling frequency.

# Framework

We use three inference categories to partition our discussion, including trend, relationships, and dynamics, and each has its own sub-inferences and models. Our writing style is the same throughout each section, where we first discuss the category itself and then sequentially walk through the inferences. During that sequence, we pose questions to orient the reader as to what the inference captures, unpack graphs and figures, and provide inference statements that can be used to guide hypothesis development. We use box-and-arrow diagrams throughout to represent the broad inferences, but we also graph a few of the more challenging inferences with mock data -- we feel that some of the inferences in the trend and relationships section are difficult to grasp without seeing them in data form. Keep in mind, however, that data are always messy. It is rare to find data where the inferences expose themselves simply by plotting -- although it is certainly possible. We are using these "data plots" to clearly convey what the inferences mean, but please be aware that field data will always be messy.

Finally, we end each inference section by pointing researchers to respective statistical models. Although we direct researchers to models, our paper is not about statistical modeling only -- it is about inferences -- and researchers therefore need to be sure that they appreciate all of the nuance before applying a recommended model. There are many complex statistical issues that arise with longitudinal modeling -- like stationarity -- and the models differ in how they handle these issues, the assumptions they make, and the data format they require. There are plenty of great references on each model, we are simply guiding researchers to those references based on the underlying inferences that interest them.
