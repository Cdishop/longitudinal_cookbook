# Dynamics

Dynamics refers to a specific branch of mathematics, but the term is used in different ways throughout our literature. It is used informally to mean "change", "fluctuating," "volatile," "longitudinal," or "over time" (among others), whereas formal definitions are presented within certain contexts. Wang [-@Wang2016] defines a dynamic *model* as a "representation of a system that evolves over time. In particular it describes how the system evolves from a given state at time *t* to another state at time *t + 1* as governed by the transition rules and potential external inputs" (p. 242). @vancouver_translating_2018 state that dynamic *variables* "behave as if they have memory; that is, their value at any one time depends somewhat on their previous value" (p. 604). Finally, @monge_theoretical_1990 suggests that in dynamic *analyses*, "it is essential to know how variables depend upon their own past history" (p. 409). In this section we discuss a number of inferences couched in the idea that the past constrains future behavior. 

Does performance relate to itself over time? Do current helping behaviors depend on prior helping behaviors? Does unit climate demonstrate self-similarity across time? Does income now predict income in the future? These are questions about the relationship of a single variable with itself over time -- does it predict itself at each subsequent moment? Is it constrained by where it was in the past?

Panel A of Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows the concept with a box-and-arrow diagram. $y$ predicts itself across every moment -- it has self-similarity and its value now is constrained by where it was a moment ago. In our diagram, we show that $y$ at time $t$ is related to $y$ at time $t + 1$. In other words, we posit that $y$ shows a lag-one relationship, where $y$ is related to its future value one time step away. Researchers are of course free to suggest any lag amount that they believe captures the actual relationship. Note that the statistical term to capture self-similarity or memory is called autoregression.

>> **Inference 1:** On average, there is self-similarity (autoregression) in $y$; $y$ relates to itself across time.

As before, after exploring the expected average we turn to variability. How consistent are the self-similarity relationships? Are there between-unit differences in autoregression in, for example, employee voice? Do we expect a large variance in the autoregression of helping behaviors?

>> **Inference 2:** There is variability in the expected autoregression of $y$. 

The next inference is about relating a predictor to our response variable while it still retains memory. Panel B of Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows a box-and-arrow diagram: $y$ is predicted by concurrent values of $x$ but it also retains self-similarity. This model is therefore said to partial prior $y$: it examines the concurrent relationship between $x$ and $y$ while statistically partialling values of $y$ at $t - 1$, or statistically accounting for $y$ at the prior moment.

Our literature has converged on calling this kind of relationship "change" because it emphasizes the difference between $y$ now and where it was in the past [e.g., @lanaj_when_2016; @rosen_who_2016]. The association asks how current $x$ relates to the difference between $y$ now and its immediately prior value. How does affect relate to change in performance? Does depletion covary with change in OCBs? Note that change can be construed from any prior time point (baseline, the prior time point, $t-3$); our literature commonly emphasizes lag-one change.

>> **Inference 3:** On average, concurrent $x$ relates to change in $y$.

The analyst is also free to assess variability in the expected change relationship.

>> **Inference 4:** There is variability in the expected change relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Change relationships do not have to be concurrent. Panel C of Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows concurrent relationships as we saw above but it also includes lags from the predictor to the outcome. $y$ retains memory, but it is predicted by both concurrent and prior values of $x$. Typically, we call these cross-lag relationships.

Questions about lag-one change relationships take the following forms. Does affect predict subsequent performance change? Do prior counterproductive work behaviors relate to current incivility change? Does metacognition predict subsequent exploratory behavior change? Of course, researchers can also explore longer lags by relating predictors to more distal outcomes. 

>> **Inference 5:** On average, there is a cross-lag relationship of change, where $x$ relates to the change in $y$ at a different point in time.

Again, typically researchers explore variability after assessing the average estimate.

>> **Inference 6:** There is variability in the expected cross-lag relationship of change.

## Extensions

We described a simple set of inferences above, but the ideas generalize to more complex dynamics as well. Often researchers are interested in reciprocal relationships, where $x$ influences subsequent $y$, which then goes back to influence $x$ at the next time point. Said formally, $x_t$ influences $y_{t+1}$, which then influences $x_{t+2}$. Said informally, current performance influences subsequent self-efficacy, which then influences performance on the next trial. These inferences are no different than what we saw above -- they are cross-lag predictions -- all we did was add more of them. Panel D of Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows reciprocal dynamics, where both $x$ and $y$ show self-similarity and cross-lag relationships with one another. 

Researchers typically posit a sequence of single cross-lag predictions when they are interested in reciprocal dynamics. For example, @hardy2018 explored reciprocal relationships among performance and motivation (self-efficacy, metacognition, and exploratory behavior). Their hypotheses include, (1) prior self-efficacy negatively relates to subsequent exploratory behavior and (2) prior exploratory behavior positively relates to subsequent self-efficacy (among others). These single inferences are used in aggregate to make conclusions about reciprocal influence.

The dynamic inferences shown here also generalize to systems of variables where a researcher posits self-similarity and cross-lag predictions across many variables. There could be reciprocal dynamics between a set of variables like performance, self-efficacy, and affect, or a sequence of influence between dyadic exchanges, performance, and team perceptions: perhaps initial dyadic exchanges influence subsequent team perceptions, which later influence performance. Following the performance change, the structure of the task updates and this initiates new dyadic exchanges. Once a researcher grasps the foundational ideas presented here he or she is free to explore any number of complex relationships.

Also notice that complex dynamics subsume the concept of mediation. It is of course an important idea, but when we focus on systems of variables and reciprocal dynamics we place our emphasis elsewhere. If readers are interested in mediation we urge them to read one of the many great papers on it [@stone2008relative; @maxwell2007bias; @maxwell2011bias]. 

## Models

@Wang2016 reviews many different types of dynamic models and, although his paper will not provide readers will specific code it is an excellent starting paper to observe the variety of dynamic models.
