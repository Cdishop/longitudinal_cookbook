# Dynamics

Dynamics refers to a specific branch of mathematics, but the term is used in different ways throughout our literature. It is used informally to mean "change", "fluctuating," "volatile," "longitudinal," or "over time" (among others), whereas formal definitions in our literature are presented within certain contexts. Wang defines a dynamic *model* as a "representation of a system that evolves over time. In particular it describes how the system evolves from a given state at time *t* to another state at time *t + 1* as governed by the transition rules and potential external inputs" (p. 242). Vancouver states that dynamic *variables* "behave as if they have memory; that is, their value at any one time depends somewhat on their previous value" (p. 604). Finally, Monge suggests that in dynamic *analyses*, "it is essential to know how variables depend upon their own past history" (p. 409). 

The crucial notion to take from dynamics, then, is memory. When the past matters, and future states are constrained by where they were at prior points in time, dynamics are at play. In this section, we unpack a variety of inferences that are couched in this idea.

Does performance relate to itself over time? Do current helping behaviors depend on prior helping behaviors? Does unit climate demonstrate self-similarity across time? Does income now predict income in the future? These are questions about the relationship of a single variable with itself over time -- does it predict itself at each subsequent moment? Is it constrained by where it was in the past?

Panel A of figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows the concept with a box and arrow diagram. $x$ predicts itself across every moment -- it has self-similarity and its value now is constrained by where it was a moment ago. In our diagram we show that $x$ at time $t$ is related to $x$ at time $t + 1$. In other words, we posit that $x$ shows a lag-one relationship, where $x$ is related to its future value one time step away. Modelers and theorists are of course free to suggest any lag amount that they believe captures the actual relationship. 

>> **Inference 1:** There is self-similarity in $x$; $x$ relates to itself across time. 

Inference one was about a single variable, and in the level and trend inference sections we saw that when we moved to multiple variables we started asking how variables relate to one another at $t$, or at an average window of $t$, or across $t$. With dynamics, where memory is a fundamental concept, we instead ask how variables relate to one another at different lags. Does affect predict subsequent performance? Do prior counterproductive work behaviors relate to current incivility? When goal discrepancy is large is effort at the subsequent time point high? When prior depletion is low, is current emotional exhaustion high?

We can capture this second inference by relating current values on one variable to future values on another. Equivalently, we can relate prior values on one variable to current values on another. Panel B of figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows this second dynamics inference. $x$ still shows self-similarity across time, but it now predicts $y$ at the subsequent moment. We are positing a lag-one relationship between $x$ and $y$. Said formally, we believe that $x_t$ is related to $y_{t+1}$ (or equivalently, $x_{t-1}$ is related to $y_{t}$). Relating current to future (or prior to current) values from one variable to another is called a "cross lag" relationship.

>> **Inference 2:** There is a cross-lag relationship, where one variable relates to another at a different point in time.

Inference two tells us whether the patterns in one variable co-occur with the patterns in another at a subsequent time point. Across time, when affect is low is subsequent performance also low? A related question is as follows: across time, when affect is low does performance increase or decrease? This second question is about change. How does one variable relate to the change in another?

When goal discrepancy is large does effort increase or decrease? When unit climate is low do perceptions of the leader change? When performance is high does self efficacy go up or down? 

All of these questions are about change, but notice that change can be construed across different lags. Change from what? Baseline? The prior time point? The last three time points? Typically change is construed with respect to the last time point. When affect is low, does performance from the last to the current time point increase or decrease? How does effort change from the prior to the current time point when goal discrepancy is high?

Panel C of figure \ref{dynamics_figure} demonstrates this idea. We are positing the same self-similarity in $x$ and the same cross-lag relationship that we saw before, but now $y$ also has self-similarity across time. The cross-lag relationship, therefore, is now capturing how $y$ has changed from the last point in time.

It is typical to think of change from the prior to the current time point, but researchers are free to move it as they please. Here are the two final inferences that capture change in different locations.

>> **Inference 3:** There is a change relationship, where one variable relates to the change in another.

>> **Inference 4:** There is a cross-lag relationship of change, where one variable relates to the change of another at a different point in time.

## Dynamics Inference Table

Again, we provide an inference table below -- this time with respect to dynamic inferences. Inference one is about autoregression, or memory in a single variable. Inference two asks how a variable at one time co-occurs with another at a different time. Inferences three and four focus on change: when one variable is high or low, does it relate to the change (an increase or decrease) in the values of another variable?

## Extensions

We described a simple set of inferences above, but the ideas generalize to more complex dynamics as well. Often researchers are interested in reciprocal relationships, where $x$ influences subsequent $y$, which then goes back to influence $x$ at the next time point. Said formally, $x_t$ influences $y_{t+1}$, which then influences $x_{t+2}$. Said informally, current performance influences subsequent self-efficacy, which then influences performance on the next trial. These inferences are no different than what we saw above -- they are cross-lag predictions -- all we did here was add more of them. Panel D of figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows reciprocal dynamics, where both $x$ and $y$ show self-similarity and cross-lag relationships with one another. 

Moreover, the dynamic inferences shown here generalize to systems of variables, where a researcher posits self-similarity and cross-lag predictions across many variables. There could be reciprocal dynamics between a set of variables like performance, self-efficacy, and affect. There could be a sequence of influence where initial dyadic exchanges influence subsequent team perceptions, which then influences later performance, and performance changes the structure of task which ultimately initiates new dyadic exchanges. Once a researcher grasps the foundational ideas presented here he or she is free to explore any number of complex relationships.

Also notice that complex dynamics subsume the concept of mediation. It is of course an important idea, but when we focus on systems of variables and reciprocal dynamics we place our emphasis elsewhere. If readers are interested in mediation we urge them to read one of the many great papers on it (cites). 

## Models

Autoregression is the statistical word for the estimate of self-similarity in a variable, the relationship between a variable now and its future value. Our literature has a history with difference scores and partialling. We debated difference scores so we have converged to partialling models. Typically we create a model with prior values of the response variable as a predictor.

                    'There is a change relationship, where one variable relates to the change in another. x_t is associated with delta y_t.',
                    'There is a cross-lag relationship of change, where one variable relates to the change of another at a different point in time. x_t is associated with change at y_t+1.')
