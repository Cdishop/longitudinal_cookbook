a recent article noted that certain classes of statistical models are innapropriate for inferences about dynamics, so it is important for researchers

3 or more measurement occasions
- excluded studies that had 3 measurement occasions but only assessed their constructs of interests once within one of those three windows (for example, measuring professional identification at time 1, resource depletion at time 2, and interpersonal harming toward coworkers at time 3; Deng, Coyle-Shapiro, Yang))
- another example: personality at time 1, emotional exhaustion at time 2, performance at time 3 (Wang, Owens, Li, Shi, 2018)
- work context variables at time 1, job crafting, satisfaction, commitment at time 2, proficiency and ocbs at time 3 (Dierdorf & Jensen, 2018).
