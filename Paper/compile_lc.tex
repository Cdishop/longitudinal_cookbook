\abstract{
This manuscript considers how to think about patterns contained in
longitudinal or panel data structures. Organizational scientists
recognize that psychological phenomena and processes unfold over time
and, to better understand them, organizational researchers increasingly
work with longitudinal data and explore inferences within those data
structures. Longitudinal inferences may focus on any number of
fundamental patterns, including construct trajectories, relationships
between constructs, or dynamics. Although the diversity of longitudinal
inferences provides a wide foundation for garnering knowledge in any
given area, it also makes it difficult for researchers to know the set
of inferences they may explore with longitudinal data, which statistical
models to use given their questions, and how to situate their specific
inquiries within the broader set of longitudinal inferences. Studies
that collect longitudinal data often only focus on one inference
category when they could investigate many more fundamental patterns and
learn additional insights about their processes of interest. Moreover,
organizational scientists commonly apply (e.g., multi-level) statistical
models inappropriate for inferences on longitudinal dynamics. Thus,
organizational scientists should know how inferences about dynamics
differ from related, over time inferences such as longitudinal
relationships and trends. In this manuscript, we develop a framework to
describe the variety of research questions and inferences researchers
may explore with longitudinal data -- we demonstrate how to think about
fundamental longitudinal data patterns.

\maketitle

Organizational scientists recognize that psychological phenomena and
processes unfold over time (Beal, 2015; Pitariu \& Ployhart, 2010).
Individuals in the workplace, over time, strive to accomplish work
goals, team members collaborate so the whole eventually becomes greater
than the sum of its parts, and managers repeatedly promote values to
build vibrant, innovative work cultures. To better understand
psychological phenomena, such as motivation, teamwork, and
organizaitonal culture, researchers must attent not to static snapshots
of behavior (Ilgen \& Hulin, 2000; Kozlowski, Chao, Grand, Braun, \&
Kuljanin, 2013, 2016) but to actors, events, variables and relationships
as they move through time. Obtaining longitudinal data allows
researchers to capture the unfolding set of events, interactions,
behaviors, cognitions, or affective reactions across a variety of
psychological phenomena. If practitioners and scholars, however, are
unfamiliar with the many questions that they can ask of longitudinal
data -- and how those questions do or do not pair with certain
statistical models -- then the inferences that they draw from it are at
best restricted and, at worst, spurious.

Researchers have the opportunity to explore many inferences when they
analyze longitudinal data. For example, researchers may examine the
shape of trajectories on psychological constructs (e.g., Did job
satisfaction generally increase or decrease during the past six
months?), how two or more constructs relate to each other (e.g., Did
team communication and cohesion positively correlate over time?), or
whether changes in one variable relate to changes in another (e.g., Did
changes in goal-setting relate to changes in employee performance?
Dunford, Shipp, Boss, Angermeier, \& Boss, 2012; Hardy, Day, \& Steele,
2018; Jones et al., 2016; Judge, Simon, Hurst, \& Kelley, 2014; Lanaj,
Johnson, \& Wang, 2016; Rosen, Koopman, Gabriel, \& Johnson, 2016; Scott
\& Barnes, 2011). Given the variety of available inferences with
longitudinal data, an organizing framework would elucidate their subtle
differences and enhance theoretical insight.

We developed a framework that organizes some of the fundamental patterns
that researchers may explore with longitudinal data. In this paper, we
use it to describe how to think about patterns contained in longitudinal
or panel data structures. Our manuscript is timely for two reasons.
First, it consolidates disparate literature. The ways of thinking (i.e.,
inference categories) that we describe are not new, they are contained
in the organizational literature already, but they are often discussed
in isolation which limits a common understanding of how they fit
together. To demonstrate this point, we conducted a brief review of
articles published in the \emph{Journal of Applied Psychology} and the
\emph{Journal of Business and Psychology} in the years 2017 and 2018
that contained three or more waves of data with every variable measured
at each time point. Twenty-eight studies were identified and, using the
study hypotheses, introductions, and discussions, classified according
to the inference categories that we discuss in this paper. Table 1
reports the frequencies of each inference across the 28 studies. The
specific inference categories (trend, relationships, and dynamics) will
be fully developed later, what matters here is that a majority of the
reviewed studies explored a single inference category, and no study
focused on all three. We are not saying that researchers and
practitioners must ask all questions possible of their longitudinal
data, but we are pointing out that other inferences and ways of thinking
about patterns exist that researchers may not be aware of. This paper
presents each inference in a single location rather than forcing
researchers to locate and parse disparate literature to understand what
they can ask of longitudinal data. Second, a recent article noted that,
despite a growing emphasis on dynamics in organizational science,
certain statistical models are inappropriate for inferences about
dynamics (Xu, DeShon, \& Dishop, in press). The authors state that
researchers should consider whether their interest is dynamics or other
over time patterns and choose their statistical model accordingly.
Researchers, therefore, need to know how dynamic inferences differ from
other, related inferences. Here, we fully describe those differences.

\hypertarget{longitudinal-research-in-applied-psychology}{%
\section{Longitudinal Research in Applied
Psychology}\label{longitudinal-research-in-applied-psychology}}

This paper is devoted to inferences with repeated measures, so we begin
with a few labels and definitions. Authors typically identify a
\enquote{longitudinal} study by contrasting either (a) research designs
or (b) data structures. Longitudinal \emph{research} is different from
cross-sectional research because longitudinal designs entail three or
more repeated observations (Ployhart \& Vandenberg, 2010). We therefore
emphasize differences on the number of observations when we distinguish
longitudinal from other types of research. Longitudinal or panel
\emph{data} are repeated observations on several units (i.e., \(N\) or
\(i\) \textgreater{} 1), whereas time-series data are observations of
one unit over time -- a distinction that focuses on the amount of people
in the study (given repeated measures). Most organizational studies
collect data on more than one unit, therefore our discussion below
focuses on longitudinal research with panel data, or designs with \(N\)
\textgreater{} 1, \(t\) \(\geq\) 3, and the same construct(s) measured
on each \(i\) at each \(t\). That is, we focus on designs with repeated
measures across many people (units) where every variable is measured at
each time point.

Longitudinal applies to both short and long-term research. An experiment
with ten trials is longitudinal, as is a study spanning 10 years that
assesses its measures once every year. Longitudinal is not reserved for
\enquote{long-term} studies that last more than one year irrespective of
the frequency of their observations. Rather, certain processes unfold
over short time horizons (e.g., decision-making on simple tasks, swift
action teams; Wildman et al., 2012) whereas other psychological
phenomena unfold over long time horizons (e.g., the development of a
shared organizational culture; Mitchell \& James, 2001), so the
informativeness of a particular study depends on its rationale, research
design, analytical work, and effective interpretation of results -- as
with any study. Short and long time horizons both offer valuable
insights.

\hypertarget{framework-for-longitudinal-inferences}{%
\section{Framework for Longitudinal
Inferences}\label{framework-for-longitudinal-inferences}}

We use three inference categories to partition our discussion, including
trends, relationships, and dynamics. Briefly, longitudinal inferences
focusing on trends assess whether trajectories follow a predictable
growth pattern, longitudinal inferences focusing on relationships assess
the relationship between one or more constructs, and longitudinal
inferences focusing on dynamics assess how one or more constructs move
through time as functions of themselves and each other and emphasize how
the past constrains the future. Each category comes with box-and-arrow
model heuristics\footnote{Note that statistical models differ from the
  term, \enquote{model heuristic.} A model heuristic is a visual
  representation only, whereas a statistical model is characterized by a
  formula explaining the data and assumptions on the errors, and the
  parameters of statistical models are estimated using an estimation
  technique. In this paper, we never use the term, \enquote{model}
  without pairing it either with \enquote{statistical} or
  \enquote{heuristic} -- the two differ substantially.} that represent
the broad inferences, research questions to orient the reader as to what
the sub-inferences capture (i.e., inferences are the answers to the
research questions that we present), and references for statistical
models that are appropriate for a given inference.

Consistent with the typical inferences in organizational science, the
inferences described here are between-unit, meaning that they reflect
the average relationship across the unit of focus for a particular study
(e.g., the relationship across people, or the relationship across
firms). The typical statistical model applied to panel data in
organizational science reflects the average relationship of interest
across units in a given sample, providing a population-level estimate of
a given relationship. Alternatively, time-series designs focus on single
units and all inferences are interpreted at the within-unit level,
generating a unit-level estimate of a given relationship. Time-series
designs, however, are not popular in our literature so they are not
described further.

Although we use box-and-arrow diagrams throughout to represent the broad
inferences, we also graph a few of the more challenging inferences with
mock data -- some of the inferences in the trend and relationships
sections are difficult to grasp without seeing them in data form. Keep
in mind, however, that data are always messy. It is rare to find data in
which the inferences present themselves simply by plotting -- althought
it is certainly possible. We use these \enquote{data plots} to clearly
convey what the inferences mean, but be aware that field data are often
noisy.

Finally, despite pointing researchers to statistical models, our paper
puts a majority of its emphasis on inferences, therefore researchers
need to be sure that they appreciate all of the nuance before applying a
recommended statistical model. Numerous issues arise when modeling
longitudinal data and the statistical models differ in how they handle
these issues, the assumptions they make, and the data format they
require. We do not speak directly to those issues here, but we refer
readers to a number of informative references for each statistical
model.

\hypertarget{trend}{%
\section{Trend}\label{trend}}

Made popular in the organizational literature by Bliese and Ployhart
(2002) and Chan (1998), trend inferences represent a class of thinking
in which researchers create an index of time and relate it to their
response variable to understand the trajectory of the dependent
variable. The first panel of Figure \ref{framework_figure} shows a
box-and-arrow model heuristic in which time is related to an outcome,
\(y\), and ultimately the analyst is interested in a variety of
questions about trend and its correlates. Trend inferences have two
components: trend itself and level. For clarity, we discuss them
separately.

\hypertarget{component-1---trend}{%
\subsubsection{Component 1 - Trend}\label{component-1---trend}}

Does affect, in general, increase or decrease across time, or is its
trajectory relatively flat? Does trainee skill generally increase over
the training session? These are questions about trend, and these first
two are specifically about linear trend. It is also possible to explore
how variables bend or curve across time. Do newcomer perceptions of
climate increase and then plateau over time? Does the response time of a
medical team decrease with each successive case but then remain stable
once the team can no longer improve their coordination? These latter
questions concern curvilinear trajectories.

Trend has to do with the systematic direction or global shape of a
trajectory across time. If we put a variable on the \(y\)-axis and plot
its values against time on the \(x\)-axis, do the values display a
stable temporal pattern? It can be thought of as the coarse-grained
direction of a trajectory. A positive trend indicates that, on average,
we expect the variable to increase over time and a negative trend
indicates that we expect the variable to decrease over time. Our first
trend research question, therefore, concerns the shape of the
trajectory.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 1:} On average in the population, is there a
positive/negative/curvilinear trend?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Many research questions and inferences begin with the average pattern
(or relationship) and then move to variability, the same applies here.
After learning about the average trend across the sample, researchers
then focus on trend variability. How much consistency is there in the
trend pattern? Do all trainees develop greater skill across time? Is
there variability in the trend of helping behaviors, or
counterproductive work behaviors over time?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 2:} Does trend differ across units?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Research questions one and two concern one variable, but they can also
be iterated across all observed variables. For example, we might
discover that -- on average -- affect and performance trends both
decrease, but there is greater variability across people in the affect
trend. Or we might learn that affect has a negative trend while
performance has a positive trend.

Correlating these trends is the next inference. Correlating indicates
co-occuring patterns, where a large, positive, correlation between
affect and performance trends indicates that people with a positive
affect trend (usually) have a positive performance trend and people with
a negative affect trend (usually) have a negative performance trend.

Figure \ref{trend_correlation} shows the inuition behind this inference
with a set of graphs. In Panel A, we plot affect and performance across
time for three individuals. Affect goes up while performance goes down
for person one, this pattern is reversed for person two, and person
three reports trendless affect and performance (i.e., zero trend). We
use different colors to label the trends for each person. The affect and
performance trends for person one are labeled with red lines, whereas
person two has green lines and person three has blue lines.

Panel B then maps those pairings onto a scatterplot that demonstrates
the (between-person) relationship among affect and performance trends.
For example, person one has a positive affect trend and a negative
performance trend, so their value in Panel B goes on the bottom right,
whereas person two has the opposite pattern and therefore is placed on
the top left (where the performance trend is positive and the affect
trend is negative). Producing this bottom scatter plot tells us that the
between-person association among affect and performance trends is
negative. That is, people with a positive affect trend are expected to
have a negative performance trend, people with a negative affect trend
are expected to have a positive performance trend, and people with an
affect trend of zero are expected to have a performance trend of zero.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 3:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship among two trends?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

The final trend inference is about identifying covariates or predictors
of trend. Does gender predict depletion trends? Does the trend in unit
climate covary with differences in leader quality?

Figure \ref{trend_covariate} demonstrates the inference in a plot. We
graph affect across time for six employees that differ by job type. The
first three individuals work in research and development, whereas the
final three work in sales. Affect trajectories tend to decrease over
time for employees in research and development, whereas affect
trajectories tend to increase for those in sales. An individual's job
type, then, gives us a clue to their likely affect trend -- said
formally, job type covaries with affect trend, such that we expect
individuals in sales to have positive affect trends and individuals in
research and development to have negative affect trends. The expected
trends are plotted as the thick blue lines.

\begin{center}

Insert Figure \ref{trend_covariate} about here

\end{center}

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 4:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship between a trend and a covariate?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Note the difference between research questions three and four. Both are
between unit, but three is about co-occuring trend patterns whereas four
is about the relationship between trend and a covariate/predictor. With
respect to our examples, inference three (i.e., the answer to research
question three) says, on average, if an individual has a positive affect
trend then we expect her to have a negative performance trend. Inference
four says, on average, if an individual is in research and development
then we expect him to have a negative affect trend.

\hypertarget{component-2---level}{%
\subsubsection{Component 2 - Level}\label{component-2---level}}

Researchers that explore trend also assess its predicted value at a
given time \(t\), and this second component is called level. Level is
almost always evaluated at the first or last observed time point --
e.g., What is the predicted level of the trainee skill trend, on average
across trainees, at the beginning of a training session? On average
across departments, what is the expected level of the department climate
trend at the end of a two-week socialization process? -- although
researchers are free to asssess level at any \(t\).

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 5:} On average in the population, what is the
expected level of the \(y\) trend at time \(t\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

After exploring the average trend level, we then move to its
variability. Trend lines have a beginning (or end) point, how consistent
do we expect that point to be across the sample? Is there variability in
affect trend starting level? Are there large differences in the expected
level of the performance trend at the last time point?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 6:} Is there variability across units in the
expected level of the \(y\) trend at time \(t\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

It is also possible to assess correlations among level and (a) trend in
the same variable or (b) level or (c) trend in a different variable.
First, consider a relationship among level and trend in the same
variable. On average, do people with low initial skill show positive
skill trends whereas people with high initial skill show negative skill
trends? Do organizations with high initial CWBs, on average across
organizations, tend to have negative CWB trends?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 7:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship between trend and level in \(y\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Second, consider a correlation between level in one variable and level
in another. On average across people, do people with low initial
performance also have low initial depletion (based on the initial levels
predicted by the performance and depletion trends)? Are organizations
with high initial turnover also expected, on average across
organizations, to have high burnout (based on the initial levels
predicted by the turnover and burnout trends)?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 8:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship between level of the \(x\) trend and level of the \(y\)
trend at \(t\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Finally, researchers are free to mix the inferences above and assess
whether levels in one variable covary with trend in another. Are people
with high initial voice (predicted by the voice trend) expected to have
negative satisfaction trends?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 9:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship between the level of the \(x\) trend at time \(t\) and the
trend in \(y\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

A note on phrasing. The inferences we explored in this section have to
do with correlating levels and trends, where a statement like,
\enquote{affect and performance trends covary between-units, such that
people with a negative affect trend have a positive performance trend}
is appropriate. There is a less precise phrase that is easy to fall into
-- and we have seen it used in our literature. Sometimes, researchers
will correlate trends and then state, \enquote{when affect decreases
performance goes up.} We urge researchers to avoid this second statement
because it is not clear if it refers to a static relationship about
trends or a statement about how trajectories move from one moment to the
next. That is, the phrase \enquote{when affect decreases performance
goes up} could refer to between-unit correlated trends, but it could
also mean something like, \enquote{when affect decreases performance
immediately or subsequently goes up.} This second statement is far
different and it should not be used when an analysis only correlates
trends or evokes predictors of trend. Again, we urge researchers to
phrase their inferences as we show here.

\hypertarget{literature-on-statistical-models-for-trend-and-level}{%
\subsection{Literature on Statistical Models for Trend and
Level}\label{literature-on-statistical-models-for-trend-and-level}}

Currently, the dominant method for analyzing longitudinal data with
respect to trend and level inferences in the organizational sciences is
growth curve modeling (GCM; Braun et al., 2013b; Kuljanin, Braun, \&
DeShon, 2011). Broad theoretical discussions of growth are in Pitariu
and Ployhart (2010) and Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010) (keep in mind
that they call growth \enquote{change}), whereas Bliese and Ployhart
(2002) describe actual growth curve analysis. Growth curves are a core
topic in developmental psychology, so there are many articles and
textbooks to read from their field. See Grimm, Ram, and Estabrook (2016)
and Singer, Willett, and Willett (2003) for two great textbooks on
growth curve modeling and McArdle and Epstein (1987) for an empirical
discussion. Two straight-forward empirical examples from our own field
include Dunford et al. (2012) and Hülsheger (2016).

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{relationships}{%
\section{Relationships}\label{relationships}}

A relationships inference explores between-unit relationships over time.
The second panel of Figure \ref{framework_figure} shows a model
heuristic, where a predictor is concurrently related to a response
variable at each time point and the relationship is typically
constrained to equality or is averaged over time. Essentially, the
inference compiles single-moment correlations. For example, we assess
the correlation between, say, OCBs and depletion at time one, again and
times two and three, and then ultimately take the average of each
individual, between-unit correlation.

Questions about static relationships over time take the following forms.
What is the relationship between helping behaviors and incivility? Does
burnout predict turnover intention? Is unethical behavior related to
self-control?

Figure \ref{relation_tvc} shows the inuition of the inference with data.
Panel A plots affect and performance trajectories for three people. The
red circles in Panel A highlight each individual's affect and
performance values at time point six. Given that we have three people at
time point six, we can calculate a correlation between affect and
performance at that moment (granted, it is a small sample). The
calculated coefficient is then graphed in Panel B with another red
circle. At time point six, the (across person) correlation among affect
and performance is large and positive.

\begin{center}

Insert Figure \ref{relation_tvc} about here

\end{center}

Panel B also shows across-person correlation coefficients for the rest
of the time points. Often these correlations are either averaged over
time or constrained to be equal. Note that when a researcher uses a
time-varying covariates, hierarchical linear, random-coefficient, or
multi-level model on longitudinal data to explore concurrent
relationships among one or more variables (and they are not analyzing
trend) they are making this inference.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 1:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship between \(x\) and \(y\)? (Typically constrained to be equal
or averaged over time).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

The first relationships inference emphasizes the expected average. As
with the trend inferences, the next question is to examine variability
in that estimated relationship across the sample. How consistent across
the sample is the relationship between distractions and fatigue? Is
there variability in the relationship between emotions and volunteering
behaviors?

\subsection{Literature on Statistical Models for
Relationships}\label{literature-on-statistical-models-for-relationships}}

Time-varying covariates (TVC) analysis is the workhorse behind
relationship inferences. Complete discussions of TVC models are located
in Schonfeld and Rindskopf (2007) and Finch, Bolin, and Kelley (2016)
and two relatively straight-forward empirical examples are in Barnes,
Schaubroeck, Huth, and Ghumman (2011) and Chi, Chang, and Huang (2015).

\hypertarget{dynamics}{%
\section{Dynamics}\label{dynamics}}

The word \enquote{dynamics} takes on a variety of meanings throughout
our literature. Informally, it is used to mean \enquote{change,}
\enquote{fluctuating,} \enquote{longitudinal,} or \enquote{over time}
(among others), but the fundemantal concept to identify with dynamics is
that the past constrains what happens next, variables have memory as
they move through time. For example, Monge (1990) notes that in dynamic
analysis, \enquote{it is essential to know how variables depend upon
their own past history} (p.~409), Vancouver, Wang, and Li (2018) state
that dynamic variables \enquote{behave as if they have memory; that is,
their value at any one time depends somewhat on their previous value}
(p.~604), and Wang, Zhou, and Zhang (2016) define a dynamic model as a
\enquote{representation of a system that evolves over time. In
particular it describes how the system evolves from a given state at
time \emph{t} to another state at time \emph{t + 1} as governed by the
transition rules and potential external inputs} (p.~242). In this
section we discuss a number of inferences couched in the idea that the
past constrains future behavior.

Does performance relate to itself over time? Do current helping
behaviors depend on prior helping behaviors? Does unit climate
demonstrate self-similarity across time? Does income now predict income
in the future? These are questions about the relationship of a single
variable with itself over time -- does it predict itself at each
subsequent moment? Is it constrained by where it was in the past?

Panel A of Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows the concept with a
box-and-arrow model heuristic. \(y\) predicts itself across every moment
-- it has self-similarity and its value now is constrained by where it
was a moment ago. In our diagram, we show that \(y\) at time \(t\) is
related to \(y\) at time \(t + 1\). In other words, we posit that \(y\)
shows a lag-one relationship, where \(y\) is related to its future value
one time-step away. Researchers are of course free to suggest any lag
amount that they believe captures the actual relationship. Note that the
statistical term to capture self-similarity or memory is called
autoregression.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 1:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship of \(y\) to itself over time? (Autoregression)
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\begin{center}

------------

Insert Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} about here

------------

\end{center}

As before, after exploring the expected average we turn to variability.
How consistent are the self-similarity relationships? Are there
between-unit differences in autoregression in, for example, employee
voice? Do we expect a large variance in the autoregression of helping
behaviors?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 2:} What is the variability across units in
the expected autoregression of \(y\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

The next inference is about relating a predictor to our response
variable while it still retains memory. Panel B of Figure
\ref{dynamics_figure} shows a box-and-arrow diagram: \(y\) is predicted
by concurrent values of \(x\) but it also retains self-similarity. This
model heuristic is therefore said to partial prior \(y\): it examines
the concurrent relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) while statistically
partialling values of \(y\) at \(t - 1\), or statistically accounting
for \(y\) at the prior moment.

Our literature has converged on calling this kind of relationship
\enquote{change} because it emphasizes the difference between \(y\) now
and where it was in the past (e.g., Lanaj et al., 2016; Rosen et al.,
2016). The association asks how current \(x\) relates to the difference
between \(y\) now and its immediately prior value. How does affect
relate to change in performance? Does depletion covary with change in
OCBs? Note that change can be construed from any prior time point
(baseline, \(t-1\), \(t-3\)); our literature commonly emphasizes lag-one
change.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 3:} On average in the population, what is the
relationship betweeen concurrent \(x\) and change in \(y\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

The analyst is also free to assess variability in the expected change
relationship.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 4:} What is the variability across units in
the expected change relationship between concurrent \(x\) and \(y\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Change relationships do not have to be concurrent. Panel C of Figure
\ref{dynamics_figure} shows concurrent relationships as we saw above but
it also includes lags from the predictor to the outcome. \(y\) retains
memory, but it is predicted by both concurrent and prior values of
\(x\). Typically, we call these cross-lag relationships.

Questions about lag-one change relationships take the following forms.
Does affect predict subsequent performance change? Do prior
counterproductive work behaviors relate to current incivility change?
Does metacognition predict subsequent exploratory behavior change? Of
course, researchers can also explore longer lags by relating predictors
to more distal outcomes.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 5:} On average in the population, what is the
cross-lag relationship between \(x\) and change in \(y\) at a different
point in time?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Again, typically researchers explore variability after assessing the
average estimate.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Research Question 6:} What is the variability over units in the
expected cross-lag relationship of change?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{extensions}{%
\subsection{Extensions}\label{extensions}}

We described a simple set of inferences above, but the ideas generalize
to more complex dynamics as well. Often researchers are interested in
reciprocal relationships, where \(x\) influences subsequent \(y\), which
then goes back to influence \(x\) at the next time point. Said formally,
\(x_t\) influences \(y_{t+1}\), which then influences \(x_{t+2}\). Said
informally, current performance influences subsequent self-efficacy,
which then influences performance on the next trial. These inferences
are no different than what we saw above -- they are cross-lag
predictions -- all we did was add more of them. Panel D of Figure
\ref{dynamics_figure} shows reciprocal dynamics, in which both \(x\) and
\(y\) show self-similarity and cross-lag relationships with one another.

Researchers typically posit a sequence of single cross-lag predictions
when they are interested in reciprocal dynamics. For example, Hardy III,
Day, and Steele (2018) explored reciprocal relationships among
performance and motivation (self-efficacy, metacognition, and
exploratory behavior). Their hypotheses include, (1) prior self-efficacy
negatively relates to subsequent exploratory behavior and (2) prior
exploratory behavior positively relates to subsequent self-efficacy
(among others). These single inferences are used in aggregate to make
conclusions about reciprocal influence.

The dynamic inferences shown here also generalize to systems of
variables where a researcher posits self-similarity and cross-lag
predictions across many variables. There could be reciprocal dynamics
between a set of variables like performance, self-efficacy, and affect,
or a sequence of influence between dyadic exchanges, performance, and
team perceptions: perhaps initial dyadic exchanges influence subsequent
team perceptions, which later influence performance. Following the
performance change, the structure of the task updates and this initiates
new dyadic exchanges. Once a researcher grasps the foundational ideas
presented here he or she is free to explore any number of complex
relationships.

\hypertarget{literature-on-statistical-models-for-dynamics}{%
\subsection{Literature on Statistical Models for
Dynamics}\label{literature-on-statistical-models-for-dynamics}}

Wang et al. (2016) review a variety of dynamic models and, although
their paper does not provide readers with specific code, it is an
excellent resource to become familiar with potential dynamic models. Xu,
DeShon, and Dishop (in press) describe why multi-level models are
innapropriate for inferences about dynamics and instead recommend a
general panel model described in Bollen and Brand (2010). See
Moral-Benito, Allison, and Williams (2019) for a similar discussion.
Other statistical models that are appropriate for dynamic inferences are
discussed in Voelkle and Oud (2015), Molenaar (1985); Molenaar and
Nesselroade (2012), Molenaar (2010), McArdle (2009), and Eschleman and
LaHuis (2014). Finally, Zyphur et al. (A, in press) and Zyphur et al.
(B, in press) discuss a number of dynamic statistical models.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

There are many different patterns to explore with longitudinal data
structures. This manuscript, by unpacking between-unit patterns, mirrors
the common questions and inferences currently emphasized by
organizational scientists. What is the relationship among a set of
constructs (averaged over time)? What is the expected trend? Are there
differences in trend (also phrased as, \enquote{between-unit differences
in within-unit change})? We organized these questions and inferences
into a fundamental set, discussed what they mean, and consolidated
disparate literature so that researchers have a single source to better
understand how to think about over time patterns. Our discussion and
figures were designed to reduce ambiguity about patterns in longitudinal
data and help researchers ask questions effectively. Ultimately,
researchers should now be able to understand the spectrum of inferences
that they can explore with rich, longitudinal data.

Between-unit questions are common and useful and they are the sibling to
an alternative lens to asking questions and making inferences with
repeated measures: within-units. Within-unit inferences emphasize
fluctuations over time rather than across units. For example, Beal
(2015) notes that many of the psychological phenomenon in which we are
interested are \enquote{sequences of events and event reactions that
happen within each person's stream of experience} (p.~5). This is a
within-unit statement: it emphasizes how a construct moves through time
within a single individual. Organizational scientists have become
increasingly interested in within-unit perspectives over the past
decade. Dalal, Bhave, and Fiset (2014) review theory and research on
within-person job performance, Grandey and Gabriel (2015) review
emotional labor and differentiate a variety of within-person
perspectives, Park, Spitzmuller, and DeShon (2013) present a team
motivation model describing within-individual resource allocation and
within-team feedback, Vancouver, Weinhardt, and Schmidt (2010) present a
within-person model of multiple-goal pursuit, Barnes (2012) describes
recent within-person approaches to sleep and organizational behavior,
and Methot, Lepak, Shipp, and Boswell (2017) present a within-person
perspective of organizational citizenship behaviors. There are many
within-person inferences accumulating in our literature, but they are
occasionally accompanied by between-person models or are dispersed and
unconnected among different content areas. An immediate next step for
future research is to create a framework for the fundamental within-unit
inferences.

Our focus was on between-unit patterns because these inferences are the
backbone of longitudinal modeling and inference in organizational
science. Moreover, there can be a tendency for researchers to believe
that they are making within-unit inferences simply because they collect
longitudinal data, our goal was to build consensus and clarity on the
fundamental between-unit ideas in longitudinal data structures.

We close with four key takeaways. First, knowing the different patterns
that you can explore with longitudinal data is crucial to operating as
an organizational scholar. These data sets are becomming more and more
common (Spector, 2019) so graduate students, practitioners, and
academics are bound to come across such data in their career. Without
knowing the fundamental patterns that are possible to explore,
researchers will have a hard time asking good questions to guide their
research designs, have a limited understanding of how to evaluate other
longitudinal research, and miss potential insights. The manuscript has
utility for both teachers and learners.

Second, questions come before statistical models. We presented ways of
asking questions and thinking about longitudinal data, and only after
discussing those concepts were possible citations for statistical models
provided. The insight here is that questions should drive research
design, data collection, and statistical modeling. A researcher first
asks, \enquote{what questions do I have?} \enquote{What inferences do I
want to make?} And only after thinking hard about those concepts moves
to questions about reserach design, data collection, and possible
statistical models that can be applied to the data that align with the
initial question. A researcher should never couch him or herself within
a single inference category simply because he or she is only familiar
with one statistical model. What is your question? What inference do you
want to make? Then choose a research approach (i.e., research design,
data collection, and statistical model) that is consistent with those
interests.

Third, and building off point two, certain questions and inferences
require specific statistical models. Xu, DeShon, and Dishop (in press)
demonstrated that multi-level (or hierarchical linear) models are
innapropriate for inferences about dynamics. Howardson, Karim, and Horn
(2017), Kuljanin et al. (2011), Braun et al. (2013a) state that the
assumptions (e.g., stationarity) of multi-level models may not best suit
data following dynamic patterns. Knowing how inferences about dynamics
differ from inferences about trends or relationships, therefore, is
critical for choosing an appropriate statistical model.

Fourth, all of the ideas presented here can be used in harmony to learn
about the temporal nature of a phenomenon. A researcher does not have to
limit him or herself to a single inference category. Each is a unique
way of asking questions about patterns contained in longitudinal data
structures and, after potentially asking many questions about the same
assessed constructs, a researcher can learn about multiple aspects of
the phenomenon.
