\abstract{
Our field is increasingly interested in how things that happen over
time, in within-person phenomena, dynamics, growth, person-oriented
frameworks, and fundamental patterns in longitudinal data structures.
Longitudinal data structures lend themselves to many different
inferences -- to different patterns that researchers may emphasize --
and there are different statistical models available for anyone armed
with repeated measures. Although the diversity of inferences and models
provides a wide foundation for exploring a content area, it can also
make it difficult for researchers to know all of the inferences
available to them, which models to evoke given their question, and how
to locate their specific study within the broader set of ``over time''
inferences. We developed a framework that situates these inferences into
a core set that exposes researchers to the variety of questions and
inferences that can explore with longitudinal data. In this paper we
unpack that framework, discuss the inferences, and link every inference
to a set of models so that researchers know where to turn given their
specific interest.

\maketitle

Organizational phenomena unfold over time. They are processes that
develop, change, and evolve (Pitariu \& Ployhart, 2010) that create a
sequence of events within a person's stream of experience (Beal, 2015).
Moreover, organizations are systems with many connected parts, and
systems are inherently dynamic. Studying these systems and processes,
therefore, requires that we attend not to static snapshots of behavior
(Ilgen \& Hulin, 2000), but to variables and relationships as they move
through time; doing so puts us in a better position to capture the
sequence, understand it, and can lead to new and interesting insights
(Kozlowski \& Bell, 2003).

Researchers explore a variety of inferences when they apply models to
longitudinal data. Some focus on whether trajectories increase or
decrease, others highlight relationships, and many appear to be
increasingly interested in dynamics (e.g., Dunford, Shipp, Boss,
Angermeier, \& Boss, 2012; Hardy, Day, \& Steele, 2018; Jones et al.,
2016; Judge, Simon, Hurst, \& Kelley, 2014; Lanaj, Johnson, \& Wang,
2016; Rosen, Koopman, Gabriel, \& Johnson, 2016; Scott \& Barnes, 2011).
How are these common ways of asking questions about patterns in
longitudinal data different?

We developed a framework to capture these inferences; a way to organize
the fundemental patterns researchers explore with longitudinal data
despite focusing on different content areas or using different
statistical models. Researchers often focus on one familiar inference
despite having the data to explore many more fundamental patterns. There
are also a number of complex statistical models lingering in our
literature and it is not always obvious for which questions they are
appropriate. We bring attention to the span of questions available so
that researchers can fully appreciate and take advantage of their data.
Although the inferences all concern trajectories over time, their small
differences have large implications for what we take away from them --
what we ultimately conclude. We provide readers with potential models
for each inference so that they can be sure that the model they evoke is
appropriate for the research question that they are interested in. In
summary, this paper exposes researchers to the span of inferences they
may investigate when they collect longitudinal data, links those
inferences to models, and parses some of the modeling literature that
may be difficult to consume for researchers with only graduate level
training in statistics.

\hypertarget{longitudinal-definitions}{%
\section{Longitudinal Definitions}\label{longitudinal-definitions}}

This paper is exclusively devoted to inferences with respect to data
sets containing repeated observations, so we begin by identifying a few
labels and definitions. Authors typically identify a
\enquote{longitudinal} study by contrasting either (a) research designs
or (b) data structures. Longitudinal \emph{research} is different from
cross-sectional research because longitudinal designs entail three or
more repeated observations (Ployhart \& Vandenberg, 2010). We therefore
emphasize differences on the number of observations when we distinguish
longitudinal from other types of research. Longitudinal \emph{data} are
repeated observations on several units (i.e., \(N\) or \(i\)
\textgreater{} 1), whereas panel data are observations of one unit over
time -- a distinction that focuses on the amount of people in our study
(given repeated measures). Most organizational studies collect data on
more than one unit, therefore our discussion below focuses on
longitudinal research with longitudinal data, or designs with \(N\)
\textgreater{} 1, \(t\) \textgreater{}= 3, and the same construct(s)
measured on each \(i\) at each \(t\). That is, we focus on designs that
measure their variables repeatedly across many people -- and every
variable is measured at each time point.

Note that longitudinal applies to both short and long-term research. An
experiment with ten trials is longitudinal, as is a study spanning 10
years that assesses its measures once every year. Longitudinal is not
reserved for \enquote{long-term} studies that last more than one year
irrespective of the frequency of their observations. Assessing variables
and relationships within a 60 minute study can be as informative as a
study that spans multiple years given adequate sampling frequency.

\hypertarget{framework}{%
\section{Framework}\label{framework}}

We use three inference categories to partition our discussion, including
trend, relationships, and dynamics, and each will have its own
sub-inferences and models. Our writing style will be the same throughout
each section, where we first discuss the category itself and then
sequentially walk through the inferences. During that sequence, we will
pose questions to orient the reader as to what the inference captures,
unpack graphs and figures, and provide inference statements that can be
used to guide hypothesis development. We use box-and-arrow diagrams
throughout to represent the broad inferences, but we also graph a few of
the more challenging inferences with mock data -- we feel that some of
the inferences in the trend and relationships section are difficult to
grasp without seeing them in data form. Keep in mind, however, that data
are always messy. It is rare to find data where the inferences expose
themselves simply by plotting -- although it is certainly possible. We
are using these \enquote{data plots} to clearly convey what the
inferences mean, but please be aware that field data will always be
messy.

Finally, we end each inference section by pointing researchers to
respective statistical models. Although we direct researchers to models,
our paper is not about statistical modeling only -- it is about
inferences -- and researchers therefore need to be sure that they
appreciate all of the nuance before applying a recommended model. There
are many complex statistical issues that arise with longitudinal
modeling -- like stationarity -- and the models differ in how they
handle these issues, the assumptions they make, and the data format they
require. There are plenty of great references on each model, we are
simply guiding researchers to those references based on the underlying
inferences that interest them.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{trend}{%
\section{Trend}\label{trend}}

The first inference category is trend. Made popular in the
organizational literature by Bliese and Ployhart (2002) and Chan (1998),
trend inferences represent a class of thinking where researchers create
an index of time and relate it to their response variable. The first
panel of Figure \ref{framework_figure} shows a box-and-arrow heuristic
where time is related to an outcome, \(y\) and ultimately the analyst is
interested in a variety of questions about trend and its correlates.
Trend inferences have two components, trend itself and level. For
clarity, we discuss them separately.

\hypertarget{component-1---trend}{%
\subsubsection{Component 1 - Trend}\label{component-1---trend}}

Does affect go up or down across time, or is its trajectory relatively
flat? Does trainee skill increase over the training session? These are
questions about trend, and these first two are specifically about linear
trend. It is also possible to explore how variables bend or curve across
time. Do newcomer perceptions of climate increase and then plateau over
time? Does the response time of a medical team decrease with each
successive case but then remain stable once the team can no longer
improve their coordination? These latter questions concern curvilinear
trajectories.

Trend has to do with the global shape of the trajectory across time. If
we put a variable on the \(y\)-axis and plot its values against time on
the \(x\)-axis, do the values tend to go up or down over time? It can be
thought of as the coarse-grained direction of a trajectory. A positive
trend indicates that, on average across our sample, we expect the
variable to increase over time and a negative trend indicates that we
expect the variable to decrease over time. Our first trend inference,
therefore, concerns the shape of the trajectory. What is the average
trend pattern across our sample?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 1:} On average across the sample there is a
positive/negative/curvilinear trend.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Researchers also ask about trend variability across the sample. Do all
trainees develop greater skill across time? Is there variability in the
trend of helping behaviors, or counterproductive work behaviors over
time?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 2:} Trend differs/does not differ across units.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Inferences one and two are about one variable, but they can also be
iterated across all observed variables. For example, we might discover
that -- on average across the sample -- affect and performance trends
both decrease, but there is greater variability across units in the
affect trend. Or we might learn that affect has a negative trend while
performance has a positive trend.

Correlating these trends is the next inference. Correlating indicates
co-occuring patterns, where a large positive correlation between affect
and performance trends would indicate that people with a positive affect
trend (usually) have a positive performance trend and people with a
negative affect trend (usually) have a negative performance trend.

Figure \ref{trend_correlation} shows the inuition behind this inference
with a set of graphs. In Panel A we plot affect and performance across
time for three individuals. Affect goes up while performance goes down
for person one, this pattern is reversed for person two, and person
three reports trendless affect and performance (i.e., zero trend). We
use different colors to label the trends for each person. The affect and
performance trends for person one are labeled with red lines, whereas
person two has green lines and person three has blue lines.

Panel B then maps those pairings onto a scatterplot that demonstrates
the between-unit relationship among affect and performance trends. For
example, person one has a positive affect trend and a negative
performance trend, so their value in Panel B goes on the bottom right,
whereas person two has the opposite pattern and therefore is placed on
the top left (where the performance trend is positive and the affect
trend is negative). Producing this bottom scatter plot tells us that the
between-unit association among affect and performance trends is
negative. That is, people with a positive affect trend are expected to
have a negative performance trend, people with a negative affect trend
are more likely to have a positive performance trend, and people with no
affect trend are expected to have no performance trend.

\end{center}

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 3:} There is a between-unit correlation among trends.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

The final trend inference is about identifying covariates or predictors
of trend. Does gender predict depletion trends? Does the trend in unit
climate covary with between unit differences in leader quality?

Figure \ref{trend_covariate} demonstrates the inference in a plot. We
graph affect across time for six employees, and these employees differ
by job type. The first three individuals work in research and
development, whereas the final three work in sales. Affect trajectories
tend to decrease over time for employees in research and development,
whereas affect trajectories tend to increase for those in sales. An
individual's job type, then, gives us a clue to their likely affect
trend -- said formally, job type covaries with affect trend, such that
we expect individuals in sales to have positive affect trends and
individuals in research and development to have negative affect trends.
The expected trends are plotted as the thick blue lines.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 4:} There are between-unit correlates of trend.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Note the difference between trend inferences three and four. Both are
between unit, but inference three is about correlating trend with trend,
whereas inference four is about the relationship between trend and a
covariate/predictor. With respect to our example, inference three says,
on average, if an individual has a positive affect trend then we expect
her to have a negative performance trend. Inference four says, on
average, if an individual is in research and development then we expect
him to have a negative affect trend.

\hypertarget{component-2---level}{%
\subsubsection{Component 2 - Level}\label{component-2---level}}

Researchers that explore trend also assess its predicted value at a
given time \(t\), and this second component is called level. Level is
almost always evaluated at the first or last observed time point --
e.g., What is the predicted level of the trainee skill trend at the
beginning of a training session? On average, what is the expected level
of the unit climate trend at the end of a two-week socialization
process? -- although researchers are free to asssess level at any \(t\).

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 5:} On average, what is the expected level of the
\(y\) trend at time \(t\)?
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

After exploring the average trend level at a certain time we then move
to its variability. Is there variability in affect starting level? Are
there large between-unit differences in the expected level of the
performance trend at the last time point?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 6:} On average, there is variability in the expected
level of the \(y\) trend at time \(t\).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

It is also possible to assess between unit correlations among levels and
(a) trend itself in the same variable, (b) levels among different
variables, or (c) trends in other variables. First consider a
relationship among level and trend in the same variable. On average, do
people with low initial skill show positive skill trends whereas people
with high initial skill show negative skill trends? Do organizations
with high initial CWBs, on average, tend to have negative CWB trends?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 7:} There is a between-unit correlation between trend
and level in \(y\).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Second, consider a between unit correlation between level in one
variable and level in another. On average, do people with a low initial
level of performance trend also have low initial levels of depletion
trend? Are organizations with high initial turnover also expected, on
average, to have high burnout (based on the initial levels predicted by
the turnover and burnout trend lines)?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 8:} There is a between-unit correlation between level
of the \(x\) trend and level of the \(y\) trend at \(t\).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Finally, researchers are free to mix the inferences above and assess
whether levels in one variable covary with trend in another. Are people
with high initial levels of voice (predicted by the voice trend)
expected to have negative satisfaction trends?

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 9:} There is a between-unit correlation between the
level of the \(x\) trend at time \(t\) and the trend in \(y\).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

A note on phrasing. The inferences we explored in this section have to
do with correlating trends, where a statement like \enquote{affect and
performance trends covary between-units, such that people with a
negative affect trend have a positive performance trend} is appropriate.
There is a less precise phrase that is easy to fall into -- and we have
seen it used in our literature. Sometimes, researchers will correlate
trends and then state, \enquote{when affect decreases performance goes
up.} We urge researchers to avoid this second statement because it is
not clear if it refers to a static relationship about trends or a
dynamic statement about how trajectories move across time. That is, the
phrase \enquote{when affect decreases performance goes up} could refer
to between-unit correlated trends, but it could also mean something
like, \enquote{when affect decreases performance immediately or
subsequently goes up.} This second statement is far different and it
should not be used when an analysis only correlates trends or evokes
predictors of trend. Again, we urge researchers to phrase their
inferences as we have shown here.

\hypertarget{models}{%
\subsection{Models}\label{models}}

Trend is called the slope in the statistical modeling literature. That
is, when a researcher estimates a model to explore whether a variable
goes up or down over time she is estimating the trend coefficient.
Again, the mean estimate will tell you about the trend itself and the
variance estimate refers to the trend variability across units. In the
statistical modeling literature these models are called growth-models or
growth-curves. Keep in mind, however, that researchers use the word
\enquote{change} informally to mean growth as well, so when you read a
theoretical discussion you may see words like \enquote{change} and
\enquote{increase} despite the researcher using a \enquote{growth}
model.

Broad theoretical discussions of growth and change are found in Pitariu
and Ployhart (2010) and Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010), whereas Bliese
and Ployhart (2002) describe how to go about running an analysis. Growth
curves are a core topic in developmental psychology, so there are many
great articles and textbooks to read from their field. See Grimm, Ram,
and Estabrook (2016) and Singer, Willett, and Willett (2003) for two
great textbooks on growth curve modeling, and McArdle and Epstein (1987)
for an empirical discussion. For two straight-forward empirical examples
in our own field see Dunford et al. (2012) and Hülsheger (2016).

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{relationships}{%
\section{Relationships}\label{relationships}}

One of the most common inferences in our literature is to explore
between unit relationships over time. The second panel of Figure
\ref{framework_figure} shows a relationships heuristic. A predictor is
concurrently related to a response variable and the relationship is
typically constrained to be equal across time or is averaged over time.
Consider, for example, the between person relationship among affect and
performance across time. This inference focuses on single-moment
correlations aggregated across time or constrained to equivalence over
time, where we assess the correlation among affect and performance at
time one, again at time two, and at time three, and then ultimately take
the average of those correlations.

Figure \ref{relation_tvc} shows the inuition of the inference with data.
Panel A plots affect and performance trajectories for each person. The
red circles in Panel A highlight each individual's affect and
performance values at time point six. Given that we have three people
for time point six, we can calculate a correlation between affect and
performance at that moment (granted, it is a small sample). The
calculated correlation coefficient is then mapped onto panel B with
another red circle. At time point six, the correlation between affect
and performance across people is large and positive.

\begin{center}

Insert Figure \ref{relation_tvc} about here

\end{center}

Panel B then shows correlation coefficients for the rest of the time
points. Often these correlations are either averaged over time or
constrained to be equal. Again, this inference is one of the most common
inferences in our literature -- when a researcher uses a time-varying
covariates, hierarchical linear, random-coefficient, or multi-level
model on longitudinal data to explore concurrent relationships among one
or more variables (and they are not analyzing trend) they are making
this inference.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 1:} On average across units what is the relationship
between \(x\) and \(y\)? (Typically constrained to be equal over time or
averaged over time).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

The first relationships inference concerned the average between-person
association. As with the trend inferences, the next question is to
examine variability in that estimated relationship across the sample.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 2:} There is variability in the between-unit
relationship (constrained across time) among \(x\) and \(y\).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{models-1}{%
\subsection{Models}\label{models-1}}

The workhorse of relationship inferences comes from time-varying
covariates analyses. A discussion of these models is found in Schonfeld
and Rindskopf (2007) and Finch, Bolin, and Kelley (2016). Relatively
straight-forward empirical examples are in Barnes, Schaubroeck, Huth,
and Ghumman (2011) and Chi, Chang, and Huang (2015).

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-14}Relating affect to performance across
units over time. The red circles demonstrate the between unit
correlation at time point six. A typical time-varying covariates model
constrains the correlation to be equivalent across time. Here, the
relationship is unconstrained at each time point.\label{relation_tvc}}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{dynamics}{%
\section{Dynamics}\label{dynamics}}

Dynamics refers to a specific branch of mathematics, but the term is
used in different ways throughout our literature. It is used informally
to mean \enquote{change}, \enquote{fluctuating,} \enquote{volatile,}
\enquote{longitudinal,} or \enquote{over time} (among others), whereas
formal definitions in our literature are presented within certain
contexts. Wang (2016) defines a dynamic \emph{model} as a
\enquote{representation of a system that evolves over time. In
particular it describes how the system evolves from a given state at
time \emph{t} to another state at time \emph{t + 1} as governed by the
transition rules and potential external inputs} (p.~242). Vancouver,
Wang, and Li (2018) state that dynamic \emph{variables} \enquote{behave
as if they have memory; that is, their value at any one time depends
somewhat on their previous value} (p.~604). Finally, Monge (1990)
suggests that in dynamic \emph{analyses}, \enquote{it is essential to
know how variables depend upon their own past history} (p.~409). In this
section we discuss a number of inferences couched in the idea that the
past constrains future behavior.

Does performance relate to itself over time? Do current helping
behaviors depend on prior helping behaviors? Does unit climate
demonstrate self-similarity across time? Does income now predict income
in the future? These are questions about the relationship of a single
variable with itself over time -- does it predict itself at each
subsequent moment? Is it constrained by where it was in the past?

Panel A of Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows the concept with a box and
arrow diagram. \(y\) predicts itself across every moment -- it has
self-similarity and its value now is constrained by where it was a
moment ago. In our diagram we show that \(y\) at time \(t\) is related
to \(y\) at time \(t + 1\). In other words, we posit that \(y\) shows a
lag-one relationship, where \(y\) is related to its future value one
time step away. Researchers are of course free to suggest any lag amount
that they believe captures the actual relationship.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 1:} On average across the sample there is
self-similarity in \(y\); \(y\) relates to itself across time.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\begin{center}

------------

Insert Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} about here

------------

\end{center}

The next inference is about relating a predictor to our response
variable while it still retains memory. Panel B of Figure
\ref{dynamics_figure} shows this second dynamic inference. \(y\) still
shows self-similarity across time but it is now predicted by concurrent
values of \(x\). When current values of \(x\) are associated with \(y\)
while accounting for memory -- i.e., partialling prior values of \(y\)
-- researchers typically call the association \enquote{change.} How does
affect relate to change in performance? Does depletion covary with
change in OCBs? Accounting for prior \(y\) means that we are assessing
the relationship between concurrent \(x\) and the difference between
where \(y\) was and where it is now.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 2:} On average across the sample concurrent \(x\)
relates to the change in \(y\) across time.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

It is also possible to assess lag relationships of change. Panel C of
Figure \ref{dynamics_figure} shows concurrent relationships as we saw
above but it also includes lags from the predictor to the outcome. \(y\)
retains memory, but it is predicted by both concurrent and prior values
of \(x\).

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Inference 3:} On average across the sample there is a cross-lag
relationship of change, where one variable relates to the change of
another at a different point in time.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Inferences one through three can also be paired with additional
questions about variability across the sample. Perhaps we expect there
to be variability in \(y\)'s self-similarity, or variability in the
relationship between concurrent \(x\) and change in \(y\).

\hypertarget{extensions}{%
\subsection{Extensions}\label{extensions}}

We described a simple set of inferences above, but the ideas generalize
to more complex dynamics as well. Often researchers are interested in
reciprocal relationships, where \(x\) influences subsequent \(y\), which
then goes back to influence \(x\) at the next time point. Said formally,
\(x_t\) influences \(y_{t+1}\), which then influences \(x_{t+2}\). Said
informally, current performance influences subsequent self-efficacy,
which then influences performance on the next trial. These inferences
are no different than what we saw above -- they are cross-lag
predictions -- all we did was add more of them. Panel D of figure
\ref{dynamics_figure} shows reciprocal dynamics, where both \(x\) and
\(y\) show self-similarity and cross-lag relationships with one another.

Researchers typically posit a sequence of single cross-lag predictions
when they are interested in reciprocal dynamics. For example, Hardy III,
Day, and Steele (2018) explored reciprocal relationships among
performance and motivation (self-efficacy, metacognition, and
exploratory behavior). They present a sequence of hypotheses including
(1) prior self-efficacy negatively relates to subsequent exploratory
behavior and (2) prior exploratory behavior positively relates to
subsequent self-efficacy (among others). These single inferences are
used in aggregate to make conclusions about reciprocal influence.

The dynamic inferences shown here also generalize to systems of
variables where a researcher posits self-similarity and cross-lag
predictions across many variables. There could be reciprocal dynamics
between a set of variables like performance, self-efficacy, and affect,
or a sequence of influence between dyadic exchanges, performance, and
team perceptions: perhaps initial dyadic exchanges influence subsequent
team perceptions, which later influence performance. Following the
performance change, the structure of the task updates and this initiates
new dyadic exchanges. Once a researcher grasps the foundational ideas
presented here he or she is free to explore any number of complex
relationships.

Also notice that complex dynamics subsume the concept of mediation. It
is of course an important idea, but when we focus on systems of
variables and reciprocal dynamics we place our emphasis elsewhere. If
readers are interested in mediation we urge them to read one of the many
great papers on it (Maxwell \& Cole, 2007; Maxwell, Cole, \& Mitchell,
2011; Stone-Romero \& Rosopa, 2008).

\hypertarget{models-2}{%
\subsection{Models}\label{models-2}}

There are a number of recent papers on dynamic modeling that cover the
inferences discussed in this section. Wang et al. (2016) reviews many
different types of dynamic models and, although his paper will not
provide readers will specific code it is an excellent starting paper to
observe the variety of models available. When a researcher wants to
explore dynamic inferences with respect to a single unit over time they
will be examining time-series data, and there are a number of models for
this application. DeShon (2012) discusses autoregressive distributed lag
(ARDL) and vector autoregressive models, and Jebb and collegues (2017;
2015) introduce ARDL and autoregressive distributed moving average
(ARIMA) models. Finally, Xu and DeShon (almost) discuss a dynamic model
first introduced by Bollen and Brand (2010). This dynamic panel model is
appropriate for researchers who want to model dynamics across more than
one unit. Moreover, it is better suited than HLM for typical situations
in organizational psychology and management (i.e., short \(t\) and large
\(N\)).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

There are many different patterns to explore with longitudinal data
structures. What does performance look like over time? Does it
fluctuate? Is the trajectory consistent across people? What is its
initial or ending level? Does it show a growth pattern? Does that growth
pattern covary with another trend? Does it move across time in relation
to another variable? Does it show self-similarity or memory? Does it
show lagged relationships with other variables? Is it part of a
reciprocal system? In this paper we presented a framework that organizes
these inferences into a fundamental set. We discussed what the
inferences mean, how to pose questions and hypotheses about them, and
linked the inferences to appropriate statistical models. As our field
dives into within-person, dynamic, and process-oriented methods we hope
this paper helps researchers understand the spectrum of inferences that
they can explore with rich longitudinal data.
