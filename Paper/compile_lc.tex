\maketitle

Organizational phenomena unfold over time. They are processes that
develop, change, and evolve (Pitariu \& Ployhart, 2010) that create a
sequence of events within a person's stream of experience (Beal, 2015).
Moreover, organizations are systems with many connected parts, and
systems are inherently dynamic. Studying these systems and processes,
therefore, requires paying attention not to static snapshots of behavior
(Ilgen \& Hulin, 2000), but variables and relationships as they move
through time; doing so puts us in a better position to capture the
sequence, understand it, and can lead to new and interesting insights
(Kozlowski \& Bell, 2003).

This sentiment is reflected in our empirical literature, where repeated
assessments are now common. For instance, Jones et al. (2016) observed
the work attitudes of pregnant women in their second trimester every
week until they gave birth. Meier and Spector (2013) examined
counterproductive work behavior over five waves. Hardy, Day, and Steele
(2018) investigated self-regulation over 20 lab trials. Finally,
Johnson, Lanaj, and Barnes (2014) observed justice behavior and resource
depletion across 10 consecutive workdays.

Armed with repeated observations, there are then different research
questions that we can explore. Jones et al. (2016) ask about trend: they
want to determine if the trajectories among certain variables increase
or decrease over time. Johnson et al. (2014) about change: they are
interested in how changes in one variable relate to changes in another
across time. Hardy et al. (2018) inquire about dynamic relationships,
where prior values on one variable predict subsequent values on another,
and this second variable then goes back to predict the first at a later
point in time. Finally, Meier and Spector (2013) examine how effect
sizes change when they vary the time lag between their independent and
dependent variable.

Researchers then evoke statistical models that are determined by their
research questions. Meier and Spector (2013) present a sequence of path
models that test increasingly longer time lags. Hardy et al. (2018) and
Jones et al. (2016) employ bivariate cross-lagged latent growth curves,
an approach similar to the latent change model used by Ritter, Matthews,
Ford, and Henderson (2016) We also find complex hierarchical linear
models in many event-sampling studies (e.g., Koopman, Lanaj, \& Scott,
2016; Rosen, Koopman, Gabriel, \& Johnson, 2016).

The spine of an investigation, finally, is to interpret the model and
make an inference regarding the original question. Jones et al. (2016)
infer negative slopes for concealing behaviors and positive slopes for
revealing behaviors. Johnson et al. (2014) state that justice behaviors
fluctuate day to day and predict changes in depletion. Hardy et al.
(2018) find support for dynamic relationships between self-efficacy,
metacognition, and exploratory behaviors. Finally, Meier and Spector
(2013) suggest that the effects of work stressors on counterproductive
work behaviors are not substantially different across different time
lags.

None of these inferences perfectly discovers the data generating
mechanism. Rather, each asks an interesting and important question about
how DVs relate to IVs. Only with lots of asking about lots of different
patterns of relationships across the variables could we piece together
one (of many) possible representation(s) of the data generating process
-- hopefully having a good theory to guide the way.

We want to link inferences to models in this paper so that researchers
know which of the many models they can use when they are interested in
one of the many possible inferences in a longitudinal investigation. As
should be clear to anyone reading our literature, there is great
excitement for the utility of longitudinal studies; they can pose
interesting questions and discover patterns that would otherwise be
impossible to capture in a static investigation. We bring attention to
the span of questions available so that researchers can fully appreciate
and take advantage of their data. Although the inferences concern
trajectories or relationships over time, their small differences have
large implications for what we take away from them -- what we ultimately
conclude. Moreoever, there are many inferences, many models, and
different models can be used to understand or explore the same
inference. In this paper, we provide readers with potential models for
each inference so that they can be sure that the model they evoke is
appropriate for the research question that they are interested in. In
summary, this paper exposes researchers to the span of inferences they
may investigate when they collect longitudinal data, links those
inferences to models, and parses some of the modeling literature that
may be difficult to consume for researchers with only graduate level
training in statistics.

Below, we do these things.

\hypertarget{longitudinal-definitions}{%
\section{Longitudinal Definitions}\label{longitudinal-definitions}}

This paper is exclusively devoted to the inferences we make with
repeated observations, so we begin by identifying a few labels and
definitions. Authors typically identify a \enquote{longitudinal} study
by making a contrast with respect to either a) research designs or b)
data structures. Longitudinal \emph{research} is different from
cross-sectional research because longitudinal designs entail three or
more repeated observations (Ployhart \& Vandenberg, 2010). We therefore
emphasize differences on the number of observations when we distinguish
longitudinal from other types of research. Longitudinal \emph{data} are
repeated observations on several units (i.e., \(N\) or \(i\)
\textgreater{} 1), whereas panel data are observations of one unit over
time -- a distinction that focuses on the amount of people in our study
(given repeated measures). Most organizational studies collect data on
more than one unit, therefore our discussion below focuses on
longitudinal research with longitudinal data, or designs with \(N\)
\textgreater{} 1, \(t\) \textgreater{}= 3, and the same construct(s)
measured on (potentially) each \(i\) at (potentially) each \(t\).

\hypertarget{framework}{%
\subsection{Framework}\label{framework}}

Level. Trend. Dynamics. These are umbrella research foci, each has its
own sub-inferences and models. Each section will basically have two
notions: trying to understand the thing itself (one variable). Looking
at trend or variability in trend. Then looking at correlates or
predictors of the thing: correlates of trend, etc.

Each section will also point to models. But there is nuance. The models
have different names, some require stationary, some don't. You need to
appreciate that and make sure you are attending to all of its nuance.
All we are doing here is pointing you in the direction.

Different literatures talk about the idea of level in different ways. In
mathematical biology a variable is referred to as a state, the span of
values that it can take is known as the state space, and its current
value is called the condition of the state. Level is therefore
synonymous with the condition of a state. Monge refers to it as
magnitude.

In the statistical literature, level is called the intercept. Level,
with respect to a certain point or window in time, is called the
intercept in the statistical literature, and we can make an inference
about the intercept at any observation point. Sometimes we are
interested in the level at the beginning of the study, other times we
are interested in the level at the last observation. We can of course
also be interested in the average level across time.

\hypertarget{level}{%
\section{Level}\label{level}}

Is employee emotional exhaustion, on average, high across the study? Is
trainee skill low at the beginning of a training session? What value are
newcomer perceptions of unit climate at the end of a two-week
socialization process? These are questions about level, or the specific
value of a variable.

We can think about level at a specific moment or averaged across a
window of time. That is, if we put a variable on the \(y\) axis and plot
its values against time on the \(x\) axis, we can explore the value that
it takes at time \(t\), or the value that it takes on average across any
span of \(t\). Figure \ref{level} demonstrates this idea graphically. A
variable is plotted across time, and the color labels indicate levels --
two at specific \(t\)'s and the third averaged across time -- that we
may be interested in.

\begin{center}

------------

Insert Figure \ref{level} about here

\end{center}

\noindent Our first level inference, therefore, concerns the value of a
variable at a specific time or averaged across a window of time.

\(t\)?}{Inference 1: What is the level of x at time t, or across a span of t?}}\label{inference-1-what-is-the-level-of-x-at-time-t-or-across-a-span-of-t}}

When we retain one variable but add multiple units -- people or
organizations, for example -- then we can look at the variability in
level. Does everyone have high affect across time? Is there variability
in the level of skill among trainees at the beginning of a training
session? We demonstrate this idea in figure \ref{level_var}, where each
unit (person) has a similar trajectory but different levels at the last
time point.

\begin{center}

------------

Insert Figure \ref{level_var} about here

------------

\end{center}

\noindent The second level inference, therefore, is about the
variability of level across units.

\hypertarget{inference-2-there-is-variability-in-the-level-of-x-at-time-t-or-across-a-span-of-t.}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Inference 2: There is variability in the
level of \(x\) at time \(t\), or across a span of
\(t\).}{Inference 2: There is variability in the level of x at time t, or across a span of t.}}\label{inference-2-there-is-variability-in-the-level-of-x-at-time-t-or-across-a-span-of-t.}}

Inferences one and two concern a single variable, but they can of course
be iterated across any or all observed variables in a study. For
example, we might discover that \(x\) and \(y\) have high average levels
across time, but that \(y\) has greater variability, suggesting
individual differences in the sample. Or we might learn that \(x\) has a
low initial level whereas \(y\)'s initial level is high.

Correlating these levels is the next inference. When \(x\) on average is
low at the initial time point and \(y\) on average is high at the
initial time point, we can correlate them to discover if units (people)
with low initial levels of \(x\) have high initial levels on \(y\) and
people with high initial levels on \(x\) have low initial levels on
\(y\).

Figure \ref{level_correlate} demonstrates this graphically. all about
the graph.

\hypertarget{inference-3-there-is-a-correlation-between-the-level-of-x-and-y-at-t.}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Inference 3: There is a correlation between

\(t\).}{Inference 3: There is a correlation between the level of x and y at t.}}\label{inference-3-there-is-a-correlation-between-the-level-of-x-and-y-at-t.}}

The final inference is horizontal. Rather than regressing a point
estimate of the level on another level, we regress the values on a
variable across time on another variable's values across time.

Questions. Is the level of affect related to the level of helping
behaviors across time? That is, when affect is high, are helping
behaviors also high or are they low? When team cohesion is low, is team
performance low as well, or is it high?

\hypertarget{trend}{%
\section{Trend}\label{trend}}

Trend has to do with the global shape of the trajectory across time. If
we put a variable on the y-axis and plot its values against time on the
x-axis, do the values tend to go up or down over time? Trend can be
thought of as the coarse-grained direction of a trajectory. Also
referred to as growth.

Does affect go up or down across our measurement period, or is it
relatively stable? Does trainee skill increase over the training
session?

These are all linear examples of trend. We can also look at curvilinear
things. Do newcomer perceptions of the positive attitude in the
workplace increase and then plateua over time? Does the response time of
a medical team decrease with each successive case but then remain stable
once every crew member has reached their maximum potential to coordinate
their actions?

The statistical term for trend is slope, and linear slopes are straight
lines whereas curvilinear slopes bend across time.

When we examine more than one unit on a variable we can also look at the
variability in trend. Do all trainees develop greater skill across time?
Is there variability in the trend of helping behaviors, or
counterproductive work behaviors over time?

When we examine two or more variables, we can of course look at trend or
slope in each of them. The next step is to then correlate slopes or
regress one slope on another. Does the trend in affect relate to the
trend in helping behaviors?

\hypertarget{dynamics}{%
\section{Dynamics}\label{dynamics}}

Dynamics refers to systems with memory. When the past matters, dynamics
are at play.

Stuff about change.

Dynamics refers to a specific branch of mathematics, but the term is
used in different ways throughout our literature. It is used informally
to mean \enquote{change}, \enquote{fluctuating,} \enquote{volatile,}
\enquote{longitudinal,} or \enquote{over time} (among others), whereas
formal definitions in our literature are presented within certain
contexts. Wang defines a dynamic \emph{model} as a
\enquote{representation of a system that evolves over time. In
particular it describes how the system evolves from a given state at
time \emph{t} to another state at time \emph{t + 1} as governed by the
transition rules and potential external inputs} (p.~242). Vancouver
states that dynamic \emph{variables} \enquote{behave as if they have
memory; that is, their value at any one time depends somewhat on their
previous value} (p.~604). Finally, Monge suggests that in dynamic
\emph{analyses}, \enquote{it is essential to know how variables depend
upon their own past history} (p.~409).

The crucial notion to take from dynamics, then, is memory. When the past
matters, and future states are constrained by where they were at prior
points in time, dynamics are at play.

\hypertarget{inference-list-1}{%
\subsection{Inference List}\label{inference-list-1}}

A variable has autoregression.

Level relationships with lags: \(x_t\) is associated with \(y_t+1\)
across time. There are cross-lag effects, where one variable relates to
another at a different point in time. Distinguish this from one
measurement at t\_1 and one measurement of y at t\_2\ldots{}this
inference is not that. This inference is about a bunch of repeated
measurements, and at each of those x predicts the next moment of y.

The inference above can be extended to include reciprocal relationships
or multiple variables.

Change relationships. \(x\) is associated with a change in \(y\). This
implies that \(x_t\) predicts \(y_t\), but \(y_t\) is no longer just the
straight observation, it is the difference between \(y_t\) and \(y_t-1\)
(or with \(y_t-1\) partialled).

Change relationships with lags. Same thing as above but now a different
lag of \(x\) is predicting change in \(y\).

\hypertarget{mediation}{%

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Points to include. 1) Econometrics modeling levels vs.~modeling
differences. 2) Keep in mind you might see weird stuff in the
literature. X at time 1 relates to Z at time 2, which relates to Y at
time 3, but none are measured repeatedly across time. This is no good.
