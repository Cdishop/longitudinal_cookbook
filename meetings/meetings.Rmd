# Post thanksgiving

1) Plots

I would be fine with no plots. But if we do plots, I think we should not use boxes and arrows. How do you differentiate all the level inferences, or the level from trend inferences, with just boxes and arrows?

Matter of factly say that level and trend on graphs, dynamics with boxes and arrows.

2) Intro

Just highlight vs. problem

3) Mediation

Is that enough? I don't want to talk about this

4) Discussion

Our own opinions?
